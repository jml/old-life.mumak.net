I saw the trailer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span> last night, and I have to admit that it looks pretty good.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />If you are capable of reading, I strongly urge you to read the book before the film comes out. This isn't <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Rings</span>, it's a graphic novel of under 400 pages. If you stick a copy in your bathroom you'll have it read inside a week.<br /><br />Please.</div>

Damn straight!  Despite my better judgement, the Watchmen movie excites me.<BR/><BR/>But there's absolutely no way that it'll be as good as the graphic novel.  Go read it, everyone!</div>
