I had meant to move this weekend just gone. I had arranged the truck, some friends to help and cleared away a space for my possessions in my new home.<br /><br />Sadly, I didn't actually <span style="font-style: italic;">pack</span><span>. Like Pope Urban VII, I expected the universe to move around me. I'm going to try to move again next week. Right now, all of my books, CDs, DVDs and odds-and-ends are all packed. Boxes are scattered on my floor like Biblical allusions in a Nick Cave song.<br /><br />Instead of moving, I revamped <a href="http://mumak.net/">my website</a>, moved <a href="http://code.mumak.net/">my professional blog</a> and set up <a href="http://mumak.net/planet/atom.xml">a feed that aggregates both blogs</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://huwshimi.com/">Huw</a> and <a href="http://puzzling.org/">Mary</a> for their help.<br /><br /></span></div>

I'd say something about how you should have a moving party and co opt the help of friends, but: don't. Just move yourself already. And then have a housewarming.</div>
