It turns out that my actual, postal address is different from my glass-and-copper Telstra address. What larks!<br /><br />I'll be in Dunedin next week, making merry with the Canonical crew. It's a little known fact that Robbie Burns, author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Auld Lang Syne</span>, was sent to New Zealand as its one and only convict.<br /><br />After that, I'll be off to Palmerston North, "suicide capital". John Cleese, famous for his roles as Q in <span style="font-style: italic;">Die Another Day</span>, has declared the town to be so "thoroughly miserable" that it can tip the scales for those iffy about offing themselves.<br /><br />Rest assured, gentle reader, that my straits are not so dire. I'll be deep-sea hacking with another kiwi colleague.<br /><br />When I return, I still won't have an Internet connection.</div>
