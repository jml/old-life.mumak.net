I like <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>. A lot of her craziness rubs me the wrong way, and I'm pretty sure there's no way I'll ever be into Shiva Nata, but she's very much worth listening to.<div><br /></div><div>She recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuff/more-ways-to-use-the-dammit-list/">Dammit List</a> – a bunch of things that you will or will not do, dammit. I like this idea, because I could do a much better job at remembering who I am and what I stand for. Some readers will recall the <a href="http://www.apuritansmind.com/christianwalk/ResolutionsOfJonathanEdwards.htm">Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards</a>, which is only fair.</div><div><br /></div><div>Havi also recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuckification/the-book-of-you/">Book of You</a> – a kind of record of your own patterns and habits that you can use to better understand who you are and how you work, and perhaps even help you to change for the better. It's a little bit like informal scientific observation, and a little bit like the advice you'll find in <a href="http://www.johnowen.org/">John Owen</a>'s works, particularly "<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/owen/mort.html">Of the Mortification of Sin in Believers</a>".</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't know what to make of a zany Yoga-teaching, Shivanaut pirate, duck-wearing blogger sharing ideas with two heavy-weight, dour, rigorous Puritans. I'm sure you have better ideas than I do.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I had to say something, it would be that there are not that many good ideas in the world. When you take old wisdom and present it as new, people listen – really listen – in a way that they don't when you merely repeat the words of dead wise men. This is why weekly sermons and <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/07/a_kinder_gentle.php">TED talks like Alain de Botton</a>'s are such good things.</div><div><br /></div></div>

<em>When you take old wisdom and present it as new, people listen</em><br /><br />That&#39;s basically Botton&#39;s core insight (or shtick, if you prefer.)</div>
