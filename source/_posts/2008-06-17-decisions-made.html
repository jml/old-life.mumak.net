I've decided to move to Nick's place in Lindfield. I've spoken with my property manager and expect to move there in a couple of weeks time. I'll miss Glebe, but I'm sure I'll find ways to console myself.<br /><br />I've also decided to take a break from World of Warcraft and focus on Free Software for a bit.<br /><br />Also, I now own a brand new filing cabinet. It is so beautiful and oblong.</div>
