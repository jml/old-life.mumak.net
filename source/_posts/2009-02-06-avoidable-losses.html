Hmm... not good :(<BR/>I suppose the other option might be to install small gps tracking devices, or more simply, magnets to all these things, and walk around with either a gps tracker thingy, OR a whacking great magnet covered in essential items :)<BR/><BR/>I guess a better idea would be to not be stressed! :)</div>

If I had to do an amateur diagnosis, I'd say that the part of my brain that tracks these things shuts down when I get stressed or tired.</div>

Hmm... the breakages happen, but a fair bit of this is a worry :-/<BR/><BR/>To do some advertising, Pacsafe, which you can get from Snowgum, etc., make neat secure but handy bags. That might fix some of the problems... <BR/><BR/>I don't know. I have a friend who seems to lose stuff a lot. I know she loses more than she says, as well, because we've been camping/travelling with them, and every time we've packed up a campsite or room for them while they've been getting the child-seat stuff together, we've always found a sock or a shirt or whatever.<BR/>I've lost about 3 things in my whole life (excluding breakages)... did miss a flight, but that was because Aidan and I managed to book on different days (same flight number and time!!).<BR/>I'm pretty sure the difference between me and my friend is that I have an obsession with/fear of losing stuff, so I'm always stupidly careful and double check everything most of the time.<BR/>I wouldn't recommend OCD though! The solution is not always better than the problem! :)</div>

Not sure how any of these problems are with money management.<BR/><BR/>An optimal bag would be nice, but I don't think that would tackle the root cause.</div>

Ignoring the ones that are problems with money management, you must be due for investment in some kind of optimal bag solution. Should you find one, a demonstration would be good.</div>
