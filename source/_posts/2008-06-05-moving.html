I've been living in a unit in Glebe for a few months now and am thinking of finding a sharehouse. In particular,  a sharehouse where everyone else has day jobs, so I can work from home without undue distraction.<br /><br />The dilemma I face is this: do I stay in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_West">Inner West</a>, or do I move to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a>? I <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> the Inner West more, but the North Shore is more convenient. O dilemma wretched! In particular, if I move to another place in the Inner West, then I should start to think seriously about switching to a more local church.<br /><br />That said, I'll be looking at a place in Lindfield on the weekend â€” let's see how it goes.</div>

Hey JML, good on you, I would love to do a personal blog but I've tried twice and got bogged, wisdom from my failures? Persevere and don't worry too much about what you write. See when I wrote that, I actually looked back and thought "Is it really true that I would 'love' to do a personal blog? In what sense do I mean 'love'?" and so on. We're up in Sydney this weekend until Tuesday morn (?) be good to see you if you're about. We're helping launch a book in your suburb actually.</div>
