And King jml opened his mouth and spoke to the peoples of the land, and he said, "Lo! There are vendors of chips that are neither salted nor hot, nay, the chips are not even warm. The cooks and merchants who profit from such chips are evil, and ruin marks their way. Therefore I will punish such evildoers and let their own misery fall upon them. Henceforth, all those who sell chips that are cold or chips that are unsalted shall be condemned to eat those chips, yea even at the point of sale." And though the vendors of the chips that were cold and the cooks of the chips that were unsalted were afraid, the people of the land rejoiced, for wisdom was found in the heart of the king's decree.</div>

Like. (You know you&#39;ve been using facebook too much when your response to good, clever playful writing is automatically reduced to &quot;like&quot;.)</div>

A real chip shop should _ask_ if you want salt, unlike this part of the world.  And also not start with frozen chips dammit.<br /><br />Serving them cold is just very very wrong though.</div>
