I finished <span style="font-style: italic;">Love in the Time of Cholera</span> last night. I love the old age and the circular story-telling and the way it didn't end tragically, even though I was expecting it to. And, of course, Marquez's writing is beautiful, even through the dim glass of translation.</div>
