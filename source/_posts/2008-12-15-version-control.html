You probably know by now that I work on <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a>, and that I help make  Launchpad and the version control tool <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bazaar</a> play nicely together.<br /><br />But if you aren't a programmer, neither of those sites are going to help you much in your never-ending quest to understand what it is I do all day. Certainly, I've always had trouble explaining version control to the uninitiated.<br /><br /><a href="http://randsinrepose.com">Rands</a> (aka Michael Lopp, author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Managing Humans</span>) describes <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/03/23/capturing_context.html">version control as capturing context</a>. If you still don't get it, ask questions here.</div>
