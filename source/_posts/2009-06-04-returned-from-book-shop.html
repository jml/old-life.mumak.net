Oh, drat you for reminding me about Kinokuniya, I&#39;m going to Sydney in a couple of weeks... last time i felt it best I didn&#39;t get into the books, having already spent close to $200 in the stationary section!!! I could have done without ever being told that shop exists!!<br />Obviously Ellison Hawker is officially the best book shop, cos it&#39;s in Hobart and the staff are great, but otherwise Kinokuniya totally counts as the best shop going!! :)</div>

Thanks for the tip.<br /><br />Most of these books are ones I&#39;ve wanted to buy for months now, so I&#39;m OK with the amateur tag :)<br /><br />That said, I was disappointed when I walked out and realized that none of the authors were new to me.</div>

Meh, an okay list for an amateur ;).<br /><br />Try Roberto Bolano. His 2666 might be your new Infinite Jest type book.</div>

Sounds like a good pack of books.<br /><br />I love Ursula Le Guin. And if she knew I existed, she&#39;d love me too.<br /><br />I&#39;m reading &quot;Lowboy&quot; by John Wray atm. It&#39;s main character is a paranoid schizophrenic. Well written one.<br /><br />Oh, and I do have plans to read Infinite Jest these holidays.</div>
