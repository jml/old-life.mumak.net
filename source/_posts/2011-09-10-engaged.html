A couple of weekends ago, Joliette and I were on holiday in Barcelona, visiting our friends Jamu &amp; Jenn.<br /><br />While we were there, the four of us walked up to the top of Tibidabo, a mountain overlooking Barcelona. We walked to the very top where Joliette and I separated from our hosts to take a closer look at the church. After looking around at its interior a bit, we went outside. I drew Joliette aside underneath some trees away from the crowds, got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.<br /><br />She said yes.<br /><br />And then I started breathing again, and gave her the ring that I had been carrying around like a fool in "Europe's pickpocketing capital".<br /><br />Since then, we've told our families, announced on Facebook and are mere hours away from deciding on a date. Wedding planning has begun in earnest. As Joliette's family is mostly in America, and mine is mostly in Australia, and we're marrying in London, we have our work cut out for us.<br /><div><br /></div></div>
