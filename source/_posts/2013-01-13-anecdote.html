<br />A funny thing happened to me the other day. &nbsp;I was sitting on my couch,&nbsp;waiting for an unusually long test run to complete and looking for&nbsp;something to keep me out of trouble when I glanced over at Jolie's&nbsp;motorcycle magazine.<br /><br />Jolie doesn't normally read motorcycle magazines, or magazines in&nbsp;general really, but she got this particular magazine for a special&nbsp;purpose. &nbsp;You see, she took her bike into the dealer for its MOT the&nbsp;other day and it turns out that everything is wrong with it except the&nbsp;engine. &nbsp;The mechanics say that it'll cost so many pounds to replace the parts and&nbsp;the bike only cost a little more than that, so now she's in the market for a new bike, and&nbsp;she's looking at bike magazines to see what she can get.<br /><br />Anyway, the magazine was open (ever heard that excuse before?), and the&nbsp;page it happens to be open on is an opinion piece called "Women and the&nbsp;art of riding ... fast". &nbsp;There's some big text in the middle saying&nbsp;"Jane Austen couldn't have won MotoGP. &nbsp;But maybe soon a woman will come&nbsp;along who can compete at the top." &nbsp;I'm quite a fan of Jane Austen and&nbsp;hate to see her put down like that. &nbsp;Also, I am intrigued, because&nbsp;everything about bikes that I didn't already learn from <i>Zen</i> and the&nbsp;art of same I learned from my wife.<br /><br />Turns out the guy has a claim, that women bikers are fundamentally&nbsp;different to men bikers. &nbsp;He has a lot of stories to back it up, too.&nbsp;Like when he was a kid, other kids said "chicks dig bikes" but actually&nbsp;they—the chicks, not the kids—dug cars instead. &nbsp;Or how he asked&nbsp;his wife if she'd still ride when he died and she said no, it would be&nbsp;too much fuss. &nbsp;Or how some woman win some bike competitions sometimes.&nbsp;Cool stories, no?<br /><br />He goes on to quote his wife saying that women aren't evolved to respond&nbsp;to stress with increased vigilance and a readiness to fight, the way&nbsp;that men are. &nbsp;Which kind of clinches it really.<br /><br />The poor guy has to fill a page with text once a month—I feel for&nbsp;him, I really do. &nbsp;I still can't help but wish that he'd have given a&nbsp;local boffin a ring or something. &nbsp;It's never going to be Pulitzer&nbsp;material, but at least you could make it look like you've put some&nbsp;effort in. &nbsp;It's a rare day that a bit of a think and a quick chat with&nbsp;your spouse is going to challenge your fundamental assumptions about&nbsp;anything, so if you're going to write about gender equality as<br />pertaining to competitive motorcycle racing you might as well do a quick&nbsp;search on Wikipedia. &nbsp;You might learn something.<br /><br />Still, it's the nature of the genre, isn't it? &nbsp;You're never going to&nbsp;get cutting edge scientific journalism in the pages of <i>Bike</i>, and even&nbsp;if you did it would still be glued together with warm stories of human&nbsp;interest, as per the standard formula.<br /><br />And then I found a fiver.<br /><br />Next week's word: Bargain.</div>
