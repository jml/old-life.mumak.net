My mate Zac is in a band called <a href="http://hmasvendetta.com/">H.M.A.S. Vendetta</a>, and their single Boganheart is available to download from their website. Check it out.<br /><br />I'm off to Montreal for two weeks. The first week is work, the second is play. I don't really know what I'm going to do, other than bum around in a cool city. If you've got any tips, I'd love to hear them.</div>

Oh yes - be sure to go to La Ville de Quebec! It&#39;s so lovely. And to the hill looking over Montreal on the weekend when everyone&#39;s there. And the old centre which you will naturally go to anyway. I&#39;m also pretty sure that the countryside around there is beautiful. You could also pop over to Nova Scotia which is cool, but alas not French.</div>

Well, I was going to suggest going underground, but when I went back to a site I&#39;d found a few years ago via photoblogs there was a big story about how they&#39;d been arrested... so you know, prob not the best idea!<br /><br />http://www.undermontreal.com/</div>
