I love checklists, but I always have trouble sharing that love with other people. Luckily, there's now a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5542406/how-to-start-using-procedure-checklists-for-flawless-task-execution">article on checklists</a> on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a>. Now I'm going to refer people to that instead of David Allen's book or my own vague fumblings about life being too short to think about boring stuff.<br /><br />If you'd like to see one I made, check out my checklist on&nbsp;<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess">how to release Twisted</a> (a free software project that I sometimes help out).</div>

I thought I liked checklists until I read this post and its links . . . but then we already know this . . . no-one really likes lists if they can&#39;t handle GTD.</div>
