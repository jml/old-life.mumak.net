Just finished a massive "Weekly Review", a time of going through all my notes, papers, flagged emails, desktop icons and processing them to see what they are and what I need to do about them. It's also a time for going through my reminder lists, getting them up-to-date and making sure everything is heading a long as normal.<br /><br />This time, I spent about four hours. If I actually <span style="font-style: italic;">finished</span> my GTD refresh last weekend, it would have taken less time. I don't feel particularly cleaner or more productive yet, but there are definitely fewer loose threads. I'm also surprised by how many good ideas I've had languishing inside my head: I'm itching for a weekend or two to spend hacking and writing.</div>

So I know that this totally doesn't apply to you at this point in time... but have you given any thought to the whole thing about having work at home and having integrated systems? <BR/><BR/>Cos it seems to me that having a weekly review is not only extremely hard to fit into my week now... it's also like I'd have to do two of them. Otherwise I don't have access to everything I need in both contexts. Plus, I'd feel a bit guilty about taking up work time doing personal review stuff. <BR/><BR/>Any thoughts?<BR/><BR/>I so want this system to work!</div>

My weekly reviews take one to two hours and I have a lot of projects underway.  It seems the most difficult part of GTD for folks is the weekly review, and most of the difficulty originates from just not doing it.<BR/><BR/>I’ve written a recent post on the weekly review, entitled, the Five W’s of a Weekly GTD Review that you and your readers might find interesting at http://johnkendrickonline.com John</div>
