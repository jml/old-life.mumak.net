I'm OK with science fiction. A lot of it is terribly written, but on the whole I accept the genre.<br /><br />That said, the kind I like best isn't really science fiction, it's <span style="font-style: italic;">economics fiction</span>, fiction that addresses what the world would be like if the rules of scarcity changed. Books like:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Dispossessed</span>, Ursula Le Guin (the best SF author ever. If you disagree, you are wrong.)</li><li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Culture</span> novels, Iain M. Banks</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Diamond Age</span>, Neal Stephenson (to a certain extent)</li></ul>In most of these stories, societies solve the "limited supply, unlimited demand" problem by inventing technology which provides an unlimited supply. Hence, they become "science" fiction.<br /><br />There's also a short story by Lord Dunsany called "The Bureau d'Echanges de Maux" which describes a market where evils, rather than goods, can be traded. Of course, Dunsany doesn't care about whether this market performs a useful economic function, so there's still areas to explore.</div>
