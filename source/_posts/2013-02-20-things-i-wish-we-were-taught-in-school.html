<b>Programming</b><br /><br />I learnt this while I was at school, but I (mostly) didn't learn it in school. Programming is such a joy to me, and has given me tools that I've been able to apply to all sorts of things.<br /><br />If you'd like to learn, you might want to try <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python</a> or (my favourite) <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>.<br /><br /><b>Organization</b><br /><br />David Allen makes this point in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_19?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=getting%20things%20done&amp;sprefix=getting%20things%20done%2Caps%2C188&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agetting%20things%20done">Getting Things Done</a>. Much of life would be easier if everyone were in the habit of actually collecting all of the inputs in their life, asking "what's the next action?", and began planning by focusing on the outcome.<br /><br /><b>Yoga</b><br /><br />Since taking up kickboxing, my flexibility has improved a lot, but I'm nowhere near as flexible as I would have been if I had been in a habit of stretching since my youth.<br /><br />My kickboxing school also has a yoga class that I've been to a couple of times. I've never done anything else that requires that combination of strength, flexibility, and self-control, and that leaves me feeling so good afterwards. I wish it were part of the regular discipline of my life.<br /><br />If you're in London, I can highly recommend KB Fitness's yoga class.<br /><br /><b>Latin</b><br /><br />I know, I'm a snob. I do wish I was conversant in a non-English language, and Latin seems a fine choice. While it wouldn't help me be a better trading partner, or actually speak to anyone, it would make me better connected with my civilization's history: the actual Roman bit; the dark Churchy bubonic bit; and the Enlightened, wigged, Whiggish bit when they cared about the Churchy bit and the Roman bit.<br /><br />One day, I'll finish working through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lingua-Latina-Illustrata-Pars-Familia/dp/1585104205">Lingua Latina per se Illustrata</a>&nbsp;and actually manage to read some Ovid.<br /><br />Failing that, they could have taught us.<br /><br /><b>Chinese</b><br /><b><br /></b>It's not just that Chinese is a different language that lots of people speak that's quite difficult to become literate in – although really that should be enough – it's also that China has a long and rich history that's very different from Western history and if we were better able to compare and contrast the two, surely we would understand ourselves and our present much better.<br /><br /><b>Data analysis</b><br /><br />Turns out that aligning your opinions with reality makes you more effective. News at 11.<br /><br /><b>Personal finance</b><br /><br />Maybe they did try to teach us this at school and I never bothered. Even so, finally getting a grip on this in my late twenties after over a decade of working for a living seems a little slow.<br /><br />The things that have helped me most with this have been a seminar that my church ran once, and the book <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/book/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a>&nbsp;(NB: I greatly dislike his website).<br /><br /><b>Logic (dressed for battle)</b><br /><b><br /></b>We learnt maths and we did proofs, but I don't remember ever being asked to evaluate something someone said and point out the bits where it was illogical. &nbsp;I don't remember any teacher ever saying that there was a difference between pointing out that an argument was flawed and claiming that a conclusion was incorrect. &nbsp;I don't remember being taught tricks like taking every time a politician said "Australia" and replacing it with "Stalinist Russia" to see if they were actually making sense.<br /><br /><b>Drawing</b><br /><b><br /></b>We had a few classes, but there weren't enough hours to get me to be able to draw. I don't want to be a good drawer of things, but I do want to be able to put pencil to paper and depict (even poorly) what I see, rather than first interpreting it to symbols and drawing pictures of the symbols. That seems a handy mental discipline.<br /><br />What do you wish we were all taught in school?<br /><br /></div>

Rhetoric.<br /><br />It&#39;s not quite the same as logic, I think, though it&#39;s related.  Much of the modern world consists of people trying to sell you something against your own interests and often against the collective interests of most well-meaning people -- most noticeably, politicians and corporations often must do this, by their nature.  The problem is not merely that they often say illogical things, it&#39;s that they also use tricks of argument specifically designed to subvert whatever defenses one already has in place against mere illogic.<br /><br />My understanding is that classical rhetoric was not taught in order to train a political class in persuasion so much as to immunize the highest ranks of the constituent class against victimization: you learned the dirty tricks of argument (each with its own Latin name) not to use them yourself, but in order to recognize when someone else was using them on you.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to know when precisely this was dropped from the curriculum, and why :-).</div>

Right choice of Latin book.<br /><br />Ovid is not really that difficult. Selections of Metamorphoses are usually adapted as some of the first stuff students read.</div>

I think personal finance, or business skills generally, are trapped on the other side of the artificial academic/vocational divide. You&#39;ll need business skills or higher maths, but never both! I doubt that divide was ever especially useful, but it certainly isn&#39;t now. When I think of the best performing 20 or so people I went to high school or undergrad with, the number of them who are in academia now is quite small (2, I think) and the number who have use for business skills is, well, everyone else.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think religious education should be imposed outside religious schools, but given that I was at a Catholic school, I think I would have benefited from both Catholic theology, and a more religion-centered view of Australian history and politics. It&#39;s got modern uses even: Tony Abbott regards himself as the DLP&#39;s and B.A. Santamaria&#39;s political heir. How one could go through a Catholic school in Australia in the 1990s and not hear Santamaria&#39;s name I do not know, but I did.<br /><br />I wish physical education had been centered more on the very fundamentals: what fitness is, how one acquires and maintains it, modifications of exercise regimes for the bottom 10% in agility, etc.<br /><br />Ethics generally. I remember in Year 8 one of the teachers questioned us over our shamelessness about, eg, lying about having done homework (well, I say &quot;our&quot;, I just did the homework, but I knew what he was talking about) in that when caught, we said things like &quot;well, it was worth a try&quot; and did not appear ashamed of lying and cheating. He recalled such things being shameful in his school days. I doubt there would have been any revolution in this if we&#39;d had some instruction in ethics, but maybe students would have intellectually understood his side of the divide on that. Plus it&#39;s an ideal life stage to begin to consider the philosophy of law, specifically, by what right does anyone have authority over anyone else?</div>

1. Arabic. I grew up (and now live again) in a country where Arabic is the 2nd most spoken language, surrounded by many countries where Arabic is the only language spoken. Not teaching us Arabic was stupid and cruel, especially if you consider that languages are quite easy to acquire until the age of twelve or so.<br /><br />2. How to be successful. As pupils we were expected to be successful at some things (like essays and exams) but no-one ever taught us how to be successful - it was assumed that we should simply do &quot;our best&quot;. It&#39;s only as grown-up that I found (by trial and error and self-education) that there are general rules one can follow for being successful at the things you do and when I did I felt a bit cheated because of all the time I wasted leaving success to luck.<br /><br />3. Science. Not the clumsy lab experiments we had in science class but rather how science actually works. It took me quite a few years after leaving school before I had a chance to catch up on even the most basic material and I suspect that most of the people I went to school with never did.<br /><br /></div>
