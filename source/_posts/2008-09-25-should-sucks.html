"Should" is the worst word in the English language. "Gubernatorial" is kind of bad, but reminds me of peanut butter and jam sandwiches. "Envisage" and "utilize" are both terrible, but at least I know what they're getting at. "Should" is plain ambiguous.<br /><br />Consider, if you will, a thirsty self:<br /><br />Self: "When will my drink arrive?"<br />Other: "Your drink should come out with the mains, sir."<br /><br />Now this obviously means "the drink will come out with the main meals unless something terrible and unexpected happens". In other words, Other <span style="font-style: italic;">expects</span> it to come out with the mains, he <span style="font-style: italic;">anticipates </span>it.<br /><br />But there's another meaning,<br /><br />Self: "When are drinks served?"<br />Other: "Drinks should be served with the mains."<br /><br />See? This isn't anticipation, this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">moral imperative</span>. Drinks <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>be served with mains, the nations <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> beat their swords into ploughshares, you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> listen to what I have to say.<br /><br />This comes up surprisingly often when talking about bugs and changes to software. I'm a little sick of it, but I don't have any good alternative.</div>

And thanks also for reinforcing the appropriate use of the letter z. It's a great letter which is under-utilized.</div>

That's why I like <I>shall</I>. Apart from the fact that the meanings of <I>will</I> and  <I>shall</I> can be inverted depending on the subject, which is just confusing, the two verbs gave a colour to the language that has been lost since everyone started using <I>will</I>  for everything.<BR/><BR/>So when the fix is in all likelihood going to be completed by Thursday, you could say it <I>will</I> be in by then, when you're implying that you're determined for the fix to occur by Thursday you can say the it <I>shall</I> happen by then, and when you're talking about an imperative, you can say that this is what <I>ought</I> to happen.</div>

Oh ho ho, how wrong you are!<BR/><BR/>UK English includes both "utilize" and "utilise", with "utilize" being preferred by the Oxford English Dictionary. <BR/><BR/>The insistence on using "-ise" is an overreaction to US English, which only allows "-ize".<BR/><BR/>Words that come directly from French are an exception (e.g. advertise, enterprise).</div>
