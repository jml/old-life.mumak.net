I liked it too. I've been having concerns about our education systems for a while and this contributed a few more pages in a mental book of critique.</div>

A fantastic talk that raises so many things for me. Let me offload (I actually wrote "overload" first!?):<BR/><BR/>- In countries where creativity *is* valued (eg dance in Latin America) the education system is dry and involves rote learning only (not that this isn't a form of intelligence). So a culture that values creativity in general doesn't necessary value it in education. <BR/><BR/>- I feel really strongly about this sort of thing. I think of very talented people who don't realise they're talented and who might even think they're dumb or a failure. Everyone - including people with disabilities - has something to offer and something that will bring them pleasure. <BR/><BR/>- What has helped me realise my talents and creativity is: being told of my talents; being given free reign (to do things my way or to decide what I will do full stop); being encouraged; being understood and supported through the glitches; being given wise suggestions/guidance. This was done (as you know) in the context of a church apprenticeship. <BR/><BR/>- I think the Christian idea of different people having different gifts, each person occupying a different, valuable part in the body has a lot to offer. <BR/><BR/>- Maybe the trickest thing educationally is that the teacher won't share all the students' gifts and it's difficult to teach people stuff *you* don't Know. But maybe that's where the model I experienced in my apprenticeship comes in. <BR/>How does all this fit with what you (used to?) think about how schools should just be to teach reading and writing and other things are for the other things? <BR/><BR/>Fi</div>

That was great! He does raise some good points and he even mentions one of my dad's favourite sermon illustrations.</div>
