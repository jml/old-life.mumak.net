My organizational system lacked vitality last year. It was rarely consulted, tedious to look at and on the whole not very fun. Now that I'm somewhat back on top of things, I think I've identified the fundamental thing that I missed, the thing I needed to breathe life into the system, much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Matrix">Creation Matrix</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collect</span><br />Every time you think of something to do, something you're unsure about or something overflowing with bodacity, <span style="font-style: italic;">write it down</span>. It's important to have a very small number of places where these written notes go, but it's more important to make the notes in the first place.<br /><br />I carry around a small spiral notebook and write in that. When I'm at my desk, I write on index cards, or in an emacs buffer called 'inbox'.<br /><br />Without this, I kept forgetting stuff, felt busier than I was and made poor decisions about what to do with my free time. I also missed lots of opportunities. Carrying around a little notebook has actually made me feel better.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>

So basically you've just realised where girls are coming from with heavy bags, and that we had it right all along? that actually maybe there is a point to having keys, purse, phone, notebook, reading book/mag, panadol and a hanky on you at all times :)</div>
