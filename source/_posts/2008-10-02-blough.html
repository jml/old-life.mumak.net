One day, perhaps a day far off, I would like to move to New Zealand and start my own town. I would call it <span style="font-style: italic;">Blough</span> and I would be the Mayor of Blough.<br /><br />Blough would be a special place because all eight correct pronunciations of its name would be correct. It's main trades would be poker, jazz music, wind farms and confused tourists. My favourite pronunciation would be "Blup".</div>

Sadly no, Der. Your choices are:<BR/><BR/> * Bluff<BR/> * Blue<BR/> * Blau (to rhyme with "cow")<BR/> * Blow<BR/> * Blaw (to rhyme with "saw")<BR/> * Bloff<BR/> * Blup<BR/> * Bluh (more of a schwa sound)<BR/><BR/>Welcome to English!</div>

Sounds idyllic. Is "laxiosjt" an acceptable pronuciation? that was the word verification and I quite like it.</div>
