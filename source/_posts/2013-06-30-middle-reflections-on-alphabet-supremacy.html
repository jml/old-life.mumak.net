Bice and I agreed that for this post we'd discuss our thoughts and reflections on the Alphabet Supremacy project so far. &nbsp;Here's mine, which mostly date from about the end of March.<br /><h3>Writing process</h3><ul><li>Knowing that I'm going to write something every week means that I'm somewhat okay with writing and publishing something that I'm not happy with. &nbsp;Part of the exercise is acquiring the discipline of getting something out.</li><li>Also, I'm treating the whole thing as exercise rather than performance. That is, I'm using it as an excuse to try things, or to get better at things that I've struggled with.</li><li>This makes me particularly grateful to readers who actually continue to read. Thank you.</li><li>Although it's not part of the rules, I'm avoiding using the bullet-point style that I prefer. That's particularly because I want to exercise writing long form prose that's coherent.</li><li>As I work on something, I very much wish that I could work on it more.</li><li>In particular, many, many ideas get discarded, some of which are better than the thing that gets published. &nbsp;Alas, time.</li><li>Also, I'm starting to learn to identify when I take the lazy way out in writing and also thinking. &nbsp;</li><li>I often want to write "Perhaps X" or "Maybe Y", and when I do, it's because I haven't taken the time or made the effort to evaluate X or Y.</li><li>Sometimes I've had what I thought were interesting ideas, and then spent a lot of time developing them and then they turn out to be trite &amp; obvious. And then I delete them, and no one notices.</li><li>Composing an essay so that it has an actual&nbsp;<i>point</i>&nbsp;is rather hard.</li><li>Writing on a topic that's chosen for me is a great way to get ideas for something,&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;else to write. &nbsp;Making the time to develop those ideas is quite hard.</li><li>As a matter of principle, I think that most writers or speakers must first be entertainers. Perhaps some people are exceptions, but I don't believe I'm one of them.&nbsp;</li><li>Why do we have principles? So we can constantly feel like failures and hypocrites.</li><li>Despite the fact that the whole reason I'm doing this is that I want to get better, I'm regularly surprised by just how hard it is to say what I mean.</li><li>I really want to be an essayist, but this far in, I think I prefer my fiction pieces more (in particular, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/bargain.html">Bargain</a> and <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/05/indifference.html">Indifference</a>)</li></ul><h3>Interaction with Bice</h3><div><ul><li>Although it's not a competition, I do make a bit of an internal decision about whether my post or Bice's is the better one. &nbsp;I haven't been keeping score though, which is most likely a sub-conscious reaction to having a lower score.</li><li>I don't read Bice's post until I've published mine. &nbsp;I accidentally did so once, and that made it very difficult for me to write mine.</li><li>We do sometimes talk about posts and our thinking process after we've written them. Most of this discussion has been logged, and it might be interesting to review &amp; perhaps publish it some time toward the end of the project.</li></ul><h3>Word Choice</h3></div><div><ul><li>Sometimes I choose words because they'll be easy for me to write about. Sometimes because I want to see what Bice has to say. Other times because I want to be forced to write about something in particular.&nbsp;</li><li>At least once, I've chosen a word because I could see opportunities for both fiction and non-fiction pieces.</li><li>We don't collude over the choice of words (except for this one!). &nbsp;We sometimes talk about it after the choice (e.g. I recently asked if "football" was deliberately chosen to make this week's post difficult for me), but we don't discuss what we're planning to write.</li></ul></div><h3>Pragmatics</h3><ul><li>Writing a post takes between two and six hours of actually sitting at a laptop, writing and editing.</li><li>With my current schedule, that's a significant but manageable amount of time. &nbsp;It mostly means I have to do less open source hacking, and do fewer spontaneous fun things on the weekend.</li><li>When I'm sick, or I have a busy weekend, or I'm travelling, it's much harder to get something done.</li><li>Blogger isn't a fun platform to compose on.</li><li>I've already missed multiple deadlines.</li><li>Jolie has been a huge help to me in getting these posts out. &nbsp;I can't overstate this.</li><li>I would love the opportunity to spend a few months working a piece that I cared about. &nbsp;However, a few months of full time writing would probably drive me mad. &nbsp;And I'd almost certainly procrastinate until the last week anyway.</li></ul><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

Ugh, no, sorry.  I wrote this before flying to the States and the word choice got lost in the timezone transition.<br /><br />Am struggling to think of anything to write about that I&#39;d actually find interesting.  How about &quot;negotiation&quot;.</div>

Have you by cunning device implied next week&#39;s word is &quot;nothing&quot;?</div>
