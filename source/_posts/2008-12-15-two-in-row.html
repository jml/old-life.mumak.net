I've just done something that's rare for me: I've read two non-fiction books in a row.<br /><br />The first is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Reason for God</span>, by Tim Keller. This is a very good book that opens with a quote from Darth Vader and then quickly settles into calm reason that actually <span style="font-style: italic;">listens</span> to both sides of the argument. This quote from the book is a great summary of something I believe very strongly:<br /><blockquote>Believers should acknowledge and wrestle with doubts--not only their own but their friends' and neighbors'. [...] Only if you struggle long and hard with objections to your faith will you be able to provide grounds for your beliefs to skeptics, including yourself, that are plausible rather than ridiculous or offensive. And, [...] such a process will lead you, even after you come to a position of strong faith, to respect and understand those who doubt.<br /></blockquote>If you want to get a good idea of my approach to questions of faith, religion and what not without me boring you to tears about it, then find some way to read the introduction to this book.<br /><br />I have some criticisms of the book, which I'll save up for another post. For now, let's just say it's very good. If you are going to read <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> book about Christianity in 2009, this should probably be it.<br /><br />The other book is <span style="font-style: italic;">Managing Humans</span>, by Michael Lopp. It's a bunch of essays about being a manager in Silicon Valley. Some of the essays skated quite close to the bleedingly obvious (particularly the meeting ones), but are helpful since they remind you to get some perspective. Others aren't relevant to me, since I'm no-one's manager or because I don't live in the Valley. Still, I think I'll want to read through it again in a couple of years time for that perspective and to be re-told the core message: the people are the business, and they are humans like me.</div>

The first sounds like a book I'd like to read. I've looked it up, but am not much interested in buying on Amazon just now, and typically it's not in the nearest library. I will read it one day though.<BR/>Thanks for bringing it to my attention :)<BR/><BR/>Also, today's magic word is "feckab". Ugh!?</div>
