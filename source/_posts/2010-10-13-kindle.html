Some recent reading I'd like to share with you:<br /><blockquote><p>Next morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I went into Motty's room to investigate. I expected to find the fellow a wreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite chirpy, reading Gingery stories.</p><p>"What ho!" I said.</p><p>"What ho!" said Motty.</p><p>"What ho! What ho!"</p><p>"What ho! What ho! What ho!"</p><p>After that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation.</p></blockquote>From <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164">My Man Jeeves</a>, by P. G. Wodehouse.</div>
