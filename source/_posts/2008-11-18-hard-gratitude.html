A couple of people have approached me privately, encouraging me to continue writing this blog. I'm touched by these sentiments, right down to the very pits of my undernourished heart.<br /><br />However, if you feel that this blog has made your day that little bit brighter, might I suggest you express your gratitude in more concrete terms. To wit, send me a tub of <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2008/03/candied_bacon_i_1.html">candied bacon ice cream</a>.<br /><br />You know you want to.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size:85%;">(Actually guys, you have no idea how much your feedback and comments mean to me. Thank you so much!)</span></span></div>

I like your blog because I like reading things people have to say, and it's different to talking because if you were ranting on about something I totally disagreed with or didn't care about I'd have to feel awkward or be rude, whereas if I'm reading I can just skip bits :p<BR/>I like blogs. I just wish there was a way to combine LJ and blogger so I could read ALL my friends updates - because I have an LJ I only hear about my three friends who are on that, and I have to check other people's by remembering, so I'll probably only read it for a month or so :(<BR/>Keep putting reminders on facebook :)</div>

I like your blog too. I like its sometimes wry, sometimes heartfelt, sometimes analytical posts. You should post more often :-)</div>

There's nothing more concrete than candied bacon icecream. Except concrete icecream.</div>
