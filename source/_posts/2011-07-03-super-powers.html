It used to be that if you asked me which super-power I wanted, I would tell you, "instantaneous, effortless, accurate, error-free teleportation". Something very much like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/">Jumper</a>,&nbsp;except with fewer determined foes and better acting. After all, that would mean no more flights, no more uphill walks, no more being late, no more forgetting things and plenty more holidays.<br /><br />But recently, I've changed my mind. I want to be <i>Video Game Man</i>. I want the super-powers that every video game character actually has that aren't even treated as super-powers.<br /><br /><b>Infinite stamina: </b>Practically every video game character can run, jump, climb and fight forever without becoming tired, experiencing fatigue or slowing down in any way. This would make kickboxing much easier.<br /><br /><b>Self-sustaining:</b>&nbsp;No need to eat, drink or sleep. Well, maybe if I got injured I could eat an apple to cure me. Think of the time saved.<br /><br /><b>Pause:</b>&nbsp;When things get too confusing or fast-paced, or when a difficult decision must be made, I could pause and take as much time as I wanted to think about it. Of course, it would only be thinking.<br /><br /><b>Quick save, quick load:</b>&nbsp;Attempt difficult situations over and over again. Accidental death would not be a problem. Negotiations could be optimized. Future knowledge could be used to enhance past decisions.<br /><br /><b>Friend or foe: </b>Know instantly who the bad guys are. No more moral ambiguity for me, thank you very much!<br /><br /><b>Know thyself:</b>&nbsp;Clear knowledge of all of my own capabilities – no more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> for me! – and also of my own status, health, wealth etc. Always obvious what I could improve and how much I could improve.<br /><br /><b>Maps:</b>&nbsp;Always knowing where I am, and where I need to go.<br /><br /><b>Unbreakable: </b>Although I could be injured, it would be impossible to break my limbs, blind me, deafen me, or even slow me down. No possible accident could reduce or remove any of my innate capabilities.<br /><br />Looking over this list, I'm reminded of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">The Culture</a>, a utopia designed by Iain M. Banks and the little I know of the <a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Gamification_Books/Reality_Is_Broken">Reality is Broken</a> meme. Which reminds me, most reader of this blog should look at "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dings/dont-play-games-with-me-promises-and-pitfalls-of-gameful-design">Don't Play Games With Me</a>".<br /><br />Oh, and if you're able to get me that teleporting gig, I guess I could be convinced to settle for that.</div>

That&#39;s a great list. Of course, I meant <i>practically</i> every video game character.</div>

Infinite stamina: Battlefield 1942 had stamina that went down when you jumped or ran; when it was empty, you could do neither. Of course, it regenerates, so it is infinite in a way.<br /><br />Self-sustaining: The Ship. You must eat, drink, and use the toilets to survive. Pathologic requires you to eat, drink, and sleep.<br /><br />Pause: I can&#39;t think of a game where not pausing is a notable, intentional feature.<br /><br />Quick save, quick load: Prince of Persia. Not only did it not have quicksave or quickload, it didn&#39;t allow you to save or load at all--you had to complete the game in one hour.<br /><br />Friend or foe: Team Fortress 2. The Spy. He&#39;s behind you.<br /><br />Know thyself: I don&#39;t know any games where you don&#39;t know your status and/or abilities as an intentional, significant feature.<br /><br />Maps: Half-Life 2. No map. No explicit direction of where to go. Of course, being largely linear, you don&#39;t have a lot of choice.<br /><br />Unbreakable: Deus Ex. Your arms, legs, head, and torso sustained damage independently. If your right arm was damaged too far, you could no longer hold a weapon. If both legs were damaged too far, you could no longer walk, but only crawl.</div>
