I've read so many good books over the last few years. Some of them seem to cry out to be read again. I know that if I read them again I'll enjoy them more, I'll know their excellences in a richer, deeper way than I do now.<div><br /></div><div>Here are the ones that leap to mind:<br /><div><div><ul><li><i>Persuasion</i>, Jane Austen</li><li><i>Underworld</i>, Don DeLillo</li><li><i>Les Miserables</i>, Victor Hugo</li><li><i>Ulysses</i>, James Joyce</li><li><i>Infinite Jest</i>, David Foster Wallace</li><li><i>War and Peace</i>, Leo Tolstoy</li></ul><div>But, should I read <i>War and Peace</i> again before I read <i>Anna Karenina</i> for the very first time? Life's but a fleeting shadow.</div></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Update:</b> How did I forget <i>Moby Dick</i>?</div></div>

I like Anna Karenina better too. Better plot and fewer preachy monologues if I recall correctly.</div>

Sadly, I haven&#39;t read any other DeLillo books. I want to read <i>Underworld</i> again partly because I enjoyed it, but mostly because I think there&#39;s depth there that I didn&#39;t fully appreciate the first time.<br /><br />Also, I didn&#39;t mention any Dostoyevsky in that list, because that goes without saying.</div>

I would vote <i>Anna Karenina</i> over <i>War and Peace</i>.  <i>Anna Karenina</i> is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />I&#39;m surprised you liked <i>Underworld</i> so much.  I never could get into that one.  Practically any other DeLillo book is better, IMHO.</div>
