Life's going OK right now, but there's a lot of travel.<div><br /></div><div>Just after settling into my flat in London, I've had to travel to Mooloolaba, which is in Queensland and is gorgeous. I've had a fun week here hacking with the Bazaar crew. Tomorrow morning I'm off to Dallas, Texas for a week and then back home to London.</div><div><br /></div><div>After then, I'll be in London for two weeks before heading back to Tassie for Lizzie's wedding. I'll be there for three weeks. If you're going to be in Tassie between December 5th and Christmas, get in touch.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, I've got a choice. I've got a thing in New Zealand in mid-January, so I might actually stay in the Antipodes until then, or I might head back to London.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still trying to figure out what my February plans are. It's a hard-knock life, eh?</div><div><br /></div></div>
