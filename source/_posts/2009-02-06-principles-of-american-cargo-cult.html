<a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html">Principles of the American Cargo Cult</a>: "An ugly image means a bad mirror".<br /><br />I like this a lot. I don't think the "American" bit is particularly fair: this is common to most Anglo cultures, I think.<br /><br />Thanks <a href="http://blog.paulswartz.net/">Paul</a>!</div>

Indeed, I think this is excellent and insightful. I don't necessarily agree with all points though.<BR/>Specifically the very first one (which I don't have now because I'm back in this window!), something about everything having a simple explanation... Didn't Einstein say something like that?! (ie why a lot of Quantum Theory is wrong!).. I know they mean it in an entirely different way, but I do believe, deep down, that things, physical processes, are fundamentally explicable. Well, until you hit "God". I don't think the Big Bang is easily explained.<BR/>Maybe that makes me American :p<BR/><BR/>I also agree with you, it probably is a generally Anglo thing... though the last set of points I think mean it does perhaps apply a little more to America - because it's that strange warped (imho) view of Christianity that gives those beliefs. I don't believe a lot of things (particularly political!), but by tagging yourself Christian people think you do. Where you have somewhere where EVERYONE is meant to believe those things (regardless of whether they do), this culture of right, wrong and retribution then grows.<BR/>I don't know.</div>
