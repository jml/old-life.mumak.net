I'm back in Sydney and well and truly into a working mindset. I might talk about some of the stuff that happened over the holidays, but first I have a bug to report in my own organizational system.<br /><br />At the moment, all of my projects and next actions live together, I make no distinction between work actions and non-work actions. I'm starting to find this a pain, because it means that when I'm "at work" there are all of these next actions on my lists that I can't do in good conscience, which slows down decision making as I mentally filter the list.<br /><br />I also wonder whether working from home makes this bug more of a pain.<br /><br />The fix might be as simple as adding a "work" context to my system. I'd love to know what you think.</div>

Yeah, splitting it might help. It's fine to have access to work AND non-work while at home/in your own time, but at work, you need to only do work (haha, says she reading your blog :p - it's my birthday, and I'll read blogs if I want to!). So making the physical distinction might help, rather than you having to mentally filter and rank (although, of course, sometimes there are things you DO need to do at work because, for instance, you can only go to the bank in business hours).<BR/><BR/>I tend to agree. Working from home seems great, and works occasionally, but I think having the office and forcing yourself to go there most days removes the 'which task do I do now' dilemma predominantly - though of course it's nice to be able to stay home where you're comfortable and there's no one to distract you with meetings etc.<BR/><BR/>I dunno. I go to uni every day and do.... stuff. Only then I just feel unjustified because I'm not making a lot of research progress and I get paid a pittance, I feel like for what I get paid and what I achieve for msyelf, I should totally be having 3 days a week at home to relax! But no, then I'd not get anything done. Meh. Life!</div>

Any progress on this one?<BR/><BR/>I think working from home probably exacerabtes this, you're right.</div>
