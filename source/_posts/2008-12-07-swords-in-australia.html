I was toying around with an idea for a short fantasy-genre story called "A guy with a sword" last night and thinking about how (if at all) it should be influenced by my own Australian nature.<br /><br />But then I was thinking, have swords ever been a big deal here? Are there any records of men dueling each other from the early days of the colony? In fact, has anyone in Australia ever been killed with an actual sword?</div>

As far as I know swords were common in the gentry way-back-when, but for little more than ornamental purposes.<BR/><BR/>It was common for certain military ranks to wear swords as part of formal dress, but certainly not for combat.</div>

There was the rather famous incident with Francis de Groot at the opening of the Harbour Bridge. No people were injured, but there was a sword prominently involved.</div>
