I was given Newton's Principia, had a bad morning, went to uni and formatted a pile of disks, failed to fix my bike wheel, messed around on facebook, solved some special relativity problems, watched some tv, and generally wished I could be outside getting fit instead of inside doing work.<BR/>But then, that's what I do basically every weekend. :)<BR/>(and at least it's That Time yet so there was no marking and no hockey umpiring!)<BR/><BR/>Sounds like you had a good weekend :)</div>

Sam &amp; I spent Valentine&#39;s day having the first lazy Saturday since we got back from Christmas holidays.<BR/><BR/>This involved a long lie-in, followed by a fried breakfast, followed by some more lazing around.<BR/><BR/>It was the best weekend in some time.</div>
