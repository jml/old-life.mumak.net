<a href="http://stripeshop.metagnome.net/">Bice</a> asked me to translate "striving for boredom" into Latin. I'm slowly teaching myself Latin in my spare time, and am still very much a beginner. I couldn't just translate it off the cuff, so here's what I did.<br /><br />First, I looked up <span style="font-style: italic;">to strive</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">boredom</span> in my Latin dictionary. It offers <span style="font-style: italic;">contendere</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">to strive</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudo </span>for <span style="font-style: italic;">boredom</span>. Then I looked up <span style="font-style: italic;">for</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">For</span> has a lot of meanings. Does it refer to advantage, duration, price, being in lieu of something, a purpose or what? I figured "purpose" looked about right and of the two suggestions I picked <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span>, guessing that <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> wasn't quite right. I confirmed this by looking up the synonym <span style="font-style: italic;">towards</span>.<br /><br />The dictionary quite helpfully tells me that <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span> expects to be followed by an accusative. So, I flipped to the back of the dictionary where it explains how to turn a noun from the way it appears in the dictionary (i.e. the nominative case) into the accusative case.<br /><br />Guess what? Latin turns out to be pretty complicated! The forms of a noun don't changed based on gender, as I had guessed, but on "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_declension">declension</a>", a made up category of grammar even sillier than gender. I knew <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudo</span> was feminine, but not which declension it was. The dictionary didn't give examples of feminine words ending with <span style="font-style: italic;">–do</span> so I resorted to the Internet. Googling for "lassitudo declension" quickly shewed it to be in <span style="font-style: italic;">declinatio tertia</span>.<br /><br />"Let's see nominative, vocative, accusative—ah! <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudonēs</span> looks right". Except that <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudonēs</span> means "boredoms". This prompted a short philosophical tangent whereby Bice and I discussed whether one could have multiple boredoms. Results were inconclusive. <span style="font-style: italic;">Lassitudem</span> looks to be right.<br /><br />So far, we have ______ <span style="font-style: italic;">ad lassitudem</span>. Time to learn verbs!<br /><br />This is where I got really confused. Is <span style="font-style: italic;">striving</span> is a gerund? I don't think so. It would be if the motto were "Striving is great", but in this case someone is actually striving.<br /><br />Tense was less tricky. It's not past, it's not future, pluperfect or future perfect. It's not passive or subjunctive either, although I don't think these are tenses. Present seems to be the only sensible choice, and the examples in the dictionary helped verify this. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contendere </span>ends with <span style="font-style: italic;">–ere</span> (not <span style="font-style: italic;">–ēre</span>!), so it looks like it's in the third conjugation.<br /><br />Latin verbs, like German ones, really seem to need a person. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cogito</span> means <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> think</span>. Bice and I decided that "We're striving" was the meaning we intended, so I went for third person. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contendo, contendis, contendit!</span><br /><br />A quick Google for "contendit ad" showed that others have used similar constructs, notably <span style="font-style: italic;">contendit ad perfectionem</span>, so at least it's not an original mistake.<br /><br />So, that leaves us with <span style="font-style: italic;">contendit ad lassitudem</span>. Not this blogger's motto, honestly!</div>
