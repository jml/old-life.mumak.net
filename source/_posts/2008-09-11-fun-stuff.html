Finished playing Portal last night. Gosh it was fun. I wish the newspaper included a daily Portal puzzle instead of those silly sudoku things. Doubt they could match the script though â€” those words have power.<br /><br />Listening to <i>Never Mind the Bollocks...</i> for the second time ever. More music like this please.<br /><br />We mean it, man.</div>

Nevermind the Bollocks... more overdubs than Dark Side of the Moon.<BR/><BR/>Sounds like: <BR/><BR/>- Stooges three albums (different to Lust for Life)<BR/>- The MC5 (live album)<BR/>- New York Dolls<BR/>- Ramones first few albums<BR/>- First Clash album<BR/>- X-Ray Spex (great girl-fronted group from the same scene)<BR/>- The Undertones, The Damned &amp; The Buzzcocks (get best of&#39;s)<BR/>- The Saints, Radio Birdman and the Birthday Party (all Australian!)<BR/>- Dead Kennedys first few albums<BR/>- X (American - Los Angeles album, and Australian bands)<BR/>- Husker Du<BR/>- Um, the Pixies of course<BR/>- Huggy Bear (cause I love them)<BR/><BR/>...and a whole heap of 80&#39;s Indie bands leading up to grunge<BR/><BR/>Most of these won&#39;t trouble you with extensive discographies.  Go with The Birthday Party and the Stooges for equal visceral impact (give them some time!)</div>

No I haven't, Der. Actually, does <I>Lust for Life</I> count?<BR/><BR/>Mikey, McLaren continues to sound like an utter tosser.<BR/><BR/>Jason, I think there's never a reason to fear the video game sequel. I don't really know why.</div>

Ah Portal.<BR/>What a wonderful game. The days proceeding the upcoming sequel will be filled with both fear and hope.<BR/><BR/>Mikey, there is an easy way for you to play it...</div>

i would like to play Portal one day.<BR/><BR/>i also would like more music like Never Mind... but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find it in the Sex Pistols&#39; discography. I like Deri&#39;s suggestion.<BR/><BR/>Little trivia: Malcolm McLaren, the manager, was all into getting the Pistols to play up their S&amp;M image. But Johnny Rotten thought this was a bit lame.<BR/><BR/>Malcolm McLaren tells them to write a song about Submission. So they write a song about a submarine mission :-)</div>
