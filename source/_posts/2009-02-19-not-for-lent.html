As part of a new lifestyle experiment, I've tweaked my router to block my laptop from all net access after 8pm.<br /><br />The idea isn't to put a total ban on all nocturnal net activity, but rather to make a space for other things in my life. I'll still be available for scheduled calls and such, of course, but no unplanned activity.<br /><br />I'll know if it works if I deng about less online, and become more focused in my evenings. I'll give the experiment a couple of months at least.</div>

It sounds similar, but not quite the same, as what I'd like to accomplish by spending less time on the 'net. Focus of that sort is definitely part of it, but there's also just a draggy feeling associated with every moment of boredom being salved with a quick email check. I get the same thing (much more rapidly) if I play too many computer games, oddly. Not so much an inferred inability to experience the present moment (as in "where has my time gone this week? oh yeah..."), or guilt but an emotional reaction rather like having eaten too much.</div>

Basically, being on the net bleeds into the evenings, and I'm never doing just one thing, because I'm always checking my email as well.<BR/><BR/>http://life.mumak.net/2008/10/attention.html gets at what I mean, I think.</div>

What is "more focussed" here? I am, coincidently, experimenting with something similar, not for focus, but for happiness.</div>
