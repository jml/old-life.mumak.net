I've been thinking a lot about getting myself an iPhone. Of course, Telstra is an ass, so I'd have to spend almost a thousand dollars to get out of my current contract -- Apple can wait. <br /><br />Read <i>Lord of Light</i> again recently; it's a great book and you should too, if you can. Started on <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>. Speaking of the Illuminati (which I rarely do out loud, hidden watchers you see), they are making a film out of Dan Brown's <i>Angels and Demons</i>. I guess it shouldn't surprise me since the first one was hilarious -- "just the way the pagans would have wanted".<br /><br />I kind of had to read <i>Lord of Light</i>, since the book I read before that was <i>The Broken Sword</i> by Poul Anderson. Well above average fantasy, of the kind you can't make any more because of <big><b>Tolkien</b></big>. You can't switch from stylized Nordic fantasy filled with Saxon verse straight to <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>, hence the Zelazny.<br /><br />Incidentally, due to cirumstances, I now believe that <i>Infinite Jest</i> uses the phrase "immantentizing the Eschaton". This belief feels erroneous, but it's there like an ill-fitting jacket that you can't get rid of since you need something to keep you warm and you can't bear the pressure of having to choose another one.<br /><br />Lindfield is boring me a lot. That and circumstances (different from the <i>IJ</i>-possiby-erroneous-belief-inducing ones) will probably mean I'll be moving again. I hate moving. If you hear about a place to move to, let me know. Ideally it would be a share house with interesting and friendly people at roughly my age group.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to Christmas. I'm sick of 2008 and am willing to take my chances with a different year. Summer too.</div>

Blogging vs doing presentations jml? ;-)<BR/><BR/>'Lord of Light' rang the highly vague bell. 'Zelanzy' clicked.<BR/><BR/>*Very* odd book IMHO. I enjoyed it, but haven't rushed to re-read. I found it ... heavy going. I prefer a lighter read. I suspect the work separation thing :-)<BR/><BR/>Would explain why my Pratchett collection is almost in tatters.</div>
