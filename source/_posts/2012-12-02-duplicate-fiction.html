<div>Jolie and I are both keen readers and have both collected quite a few books during our years apart. Every shelf is covered in books, and practically every flat surface has at least one book on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, since we moved in to this place last April/May, I've been annoyed by the lack of order to our book collection. When we arrived, we just took books out of boxes and shoved them into the nearest shelf with a gap. I've been threatening to organize them all for some time now, but ... well, there's almost always something more interesting, important or urgent to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's annoying because there's a silly way in which my books form a part of my identity. It's silly for so many reasons.&nbsp;I haven't curated my own book collection very carefully. If I look at the books there I can tell there are many formative books in my own experience that are missing, and that there's a lot of mostly harmless entertaining junk. I wouldn't want someone drawing conclusions about me from my bookshelf.</div><div><br /></div><div>And yet they are the possessions that I value most, and the ones that I've kept with me through many moves and many years. A friend of mine, commenting on a difficult move to another city said, "Home is where your stuff is", that having your belongings around makes you feel like you belong.</div><div><br /></div>Anyway, yesterday I came down with a cold. I don't know how it is for you, but whenever I get a cold I alternate between langour and manic fits of dizzy, half-crazed buzzing. There's not &nbsp; enough focus to channel it into useful hacking or study, but it's great for doing menial tasks.<div><br /></div><div>So today I've used a couple of spare hours to get the poetry, plays and fiction separated from the rest of the books and sorted alphabetically by author. I can't tell you how good it feels to look at them all lined up in order.</div><div><br /></div><div>One pleasant outcome is that it made it really easy to identify the books that we both own. We both know our taste in fiction overlaps quite a bit, but how does that manifest itself in our library? Well, now we know:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GDBXqEwQ6B0/ULuQD6OSZYI/AAAAAAAAAkg/lwQErR5anZU/s1600/dupe-books.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GDBXqEwQ6B0/ULuQD6OSZYI/AAAAAAAAAkg/lwQErR5anZU/s400/dupe-books.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Our duplicate books</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Here's what they were:</div><div><ul><li><i>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</i>, Douglas Adams</li><li><i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, John Bunyan</li><li><i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</i>, Susanna Clarke</li><li><i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, Philip K.
