<div class='post'>
I've had a cold this week and I'm getting the cough I get after I get colds of this kind. My right arm feels like it has been twisted backwards in my right arm socket. The days are getting warmer and muggier and the nights aren't cold enough to let me sleep.<br /><br />But that's all ripples on the surface. Beneath the churn is an ocean that's unaffected. I'd say a calm ocean, but that would be lying. If we had to stretch the metaphor further (and I feel we must), then I'd say there's at least some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> going on down there.<br /><br />Reflecting on a year in Sydney, I realize that the words spoken by all my friends last year were true. It is a big place that's hard to get around. It is difficult to make friends here, even in church. I'm still trying to figure out what this means for next year.<br /><br />In other news, I've finished reading <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>. I like it a lot, but I can't help but feel that it's a shallower knock-off of <i>Infinite Jest</i>, even if it was published twenty years before it.</div>
