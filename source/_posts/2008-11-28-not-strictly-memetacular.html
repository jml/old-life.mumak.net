So, the idea behind the page 56 thing is to get the book <span style="font-style: italic;">nearest</span> you, not the smartest one or the one you're reading or the one with the best line. That's what -- oh my, a car crash -- <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2008/11/page-56.html">my last post</a> was about. Still, I came across this in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</span> last night, and thought you might be interested:<br /><br /><blockquote>Besides, he had already formed his own theory about Fernando Poo: he was convinced that BUGGER--Blowhard's Unreformed Gangsters, Goons, and Espionage Renegades, an international conspiracy of criminals and double agents, led by the infamous and mysterious Eric "the Red" Blowhard--was behind it all.</blockquote><br /><br />"He" is 00005, a British secret agent. As best as I can tell so far, he's a fairly minor character. Seen <span style="font-style:italic;">Quantum of Solace</span> yet? What did you think?</div>

Ha, this is funny. I JUST completed this game on facebook. The closest book to me was the trilogy.<BR/>I googled the phrase to see what came up...and here I am. <BR/>The Probability Drive is phenomenal in this case!</div>

That's fair enough. Mostly I'm just sitting back, enjoying the ride and don't care very much if any of it ever makes sense.</div>

The fact that you are wondering if a character is minor or not in the Illuminatus Trilogy suggests that you might not quite have got how this book works (or otherwise) yet...</div>

A few days ago the local cinema was advertising <I>Quantom of Solace</I>.  I wonder what that would have been like!</div>
