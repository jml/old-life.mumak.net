I'm officially giving up on <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>. I don't like it. It doesn't feel solid, the keyboard shortcuts are confusing, the animation bugs me and I can't really figure out how to get my 'system' in there.<br /><br />It's really the feeling that gets to me. It somehow feels flaky, unpredictable. I <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> this is partly due to the way it handles item selection. It's never really clear what's selected and what's not. The impression I get is that they are trying to copy Gmail (a worthy goal) and not quite making it.<br /><br />Instead, I'll be going back to Emacs (my text editor, kind of like an acid-breathing, gamma-radiated Notepad that has an adamantium skeleton and can walk through walls). It's not ideal, but I reckon it will be more effective than RTM. The ideal system would be <span style="font-style: italic;">fun</span> to use, Emacs is merely <span style="font-style: italic;">not painful</span>.<br /><br />Do you have a suggestion for fun Linux task management software?</div>

The problem with web-based stuff is that it's only available when I'm online. My mobile phone is just a mobile phone, so I can't really use it for todo management.<BR/><BR/>I'm having a look at Toodledo now...</div>

I've been playing with Thttp://www.toodledo.com/ and it seems to work okay.  Both RTM and Toodledo work with the ToDo on the iphone which is what I wanted.  Although I am also in the Emacs congregation I echo what intellectronica said.  I need my todo list on more than one computer.</div>

Yeah, I've gone off the milk too. Just couldn't get over the fact that it wasn't integrated with my diary (at the time, google calendar).<BR/><BR/>Nick's just bought Omni Focus for his macbook and is loving it.</div>

I still use RTM, although I also find some aspects of the UI annoying (yes, item selection in particular is appalling).<BR/><BR/>The problem with Emacs (or any other desktop software) is that it's only available on one computer (or at least on computers from which I can open a terminal connection). After getting used to having access to my todo list from my phone, email, jabber, etc'... I don't think I can go back.<BR/><BR/>If you find a decent web todo, though, let us know!</div>
