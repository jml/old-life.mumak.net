I'm really, really thinking of getting myself a smart phone. Something that I can carry around that has a good calendar, a good address book, a good todo list manager and a way to quickly make notes that I can easily process later.<br /><br />Maybe it doesn't have to be a phone. Maybe it can be a separate device. I don't know.<br /><br />I would get an iPhone, but I'm currently on a plan. The Android phone (marketed as HTC Dream in Australia) looks kind of cool, but... uhh... it doesn't look like I can buy one outright.<br /><br />Whatever happened to <span style="font-style: italic;">owning</span> things?</div>

Yeah, but I have ownership-style rights for all of the Free Software. <BR/><BR/>I want to own the telephone handset so that I can keep it if / when I leave the country.</div>

EULA!!<BR/><BR/>Ownership and computers have been separating for a very long time.<BR/>Ownership in general is in decline. The banks own most of the houses, &quot;rich people&quot; own the rest (or the banks do) so we can pay them weekly to live in them. You don&#39;t own your phone unless you&#39;re prepaid (in which case you don&#39;t own the right to make calls at any time, only if you&#39;ve paid for credit for that month!). You CAN own your car, but chances are if you do it&#39;s &gt;15 years old and no other bugger wants it.<BR/>You own your clothes, but similar story - not many people want them once you&#39;re over them. Ditto appliances.<BR/>You DO own your computer (unless you do the Harvey norman thing), but you don&#39;t *really* own anything on it unless you wrote it yourself. But then, someone else still has the IP for the OS, and hell, for the chip underneath it too.<BR/><BR/>But then, do you actually NEED to own anything other than the shirt on your back? sure it&#39;d be nice, but I guess not strictly speaking, essential. And that&#39;s where EULAs come in... bastards reserving the right to be bastards one day.<BR/>And really, that&#39;s what a phone contract is.</div>
