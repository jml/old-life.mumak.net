<span class="huge">I came across this quote the other day:<br /></span><blockquote><span class="huge">"Life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece.</span>"<br /><span class="bodybold"> Nadia Boulanger<br /></span></blockquote><span class="bodybold">I think it's one of the most true things I've heard.<br /><br />It also meshes nicely with Augustine's idea that the present <span style="font-style: italic;">is </span>attention, or at least a projection of attention. On to what, I don't know â€” eternity?<br /></span></div>
