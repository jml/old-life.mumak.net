<i>The Fatal Shore</i> by Robert Hughes is excellent. Everyone should read it, especially if they are Australian.<div><br /></div><div><div>It's a well-written, intelligent history of Australia's convict system. It looks into the forces in England that led to the system and the settlement of Australia, it talks about the way Australian society perceived itself, England and the native people of Australia.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Tasmanians will relish the large amount of attention paid to our island.</div><div><br /></div><div>Read it.</div></div>

My mother went through a phase of reading in this line and also recommends Watkin Tench&#39;s diaries. (As primary sources from Sydney, they&#39;re all Sydney-Sydney-Sydney of course.)<br /><br />I like Inga Clendinnen&#39;s &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot; too (also Sydney-Sydney-Sydney).</div>
