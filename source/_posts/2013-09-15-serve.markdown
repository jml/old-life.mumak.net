I've moved this blog and [my technical blog](http://code.mumak.net) over to
[Octopress](http://octopress.org), which is a very geeky way of blogging that
allows me to write blog posts using the tools I use to write code.

Blogger is nice for what it is, but it's actually a hassle to use for
composition.  It doesn't have rich styles for formatting, doesn't allow
footnotes, and has very poor support for managing literal line breaks, which
is critically important when you are writing about source code.

It has great, built-in support for analysing the traffic that comes to the
site, but that's not something that's very useful to me.  It turns out, gentle
reader, that you are one of a very select group.

The new blog pages are being served by [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/), in a
manner which I do not yet understand.  These things are liable to change.

My plan ultimately is to move all of my technical properties – blogs, project
pages, essays – under the [mumak.net](http://mumak.net) domain name and have
the [code.mumak.net](http://code.mumak.net) URLs redirect there.  The
[life.mumak.net](http://life.mumak.net) would move to my halfwise domains.

mumak.net is the more established of the two domains by a long way, and is
more associated with my programming and open source work.  The current home
page is extremely stale, and does a poor job of reflecting my interests.  My
hope is that by serving it with fresher technologies that I actually enjoy
using, and by lowering the barrier to publication, I'll have something that
is more interesting to me and perhaps more interesting to others.

The
[Alphabet Supremacy](http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html)
project has meant that almost all of my writing time has been devoted to
non-technical things.  It's fun, but my appetite for open source hacking and
for technical writing has been whetted by stimulating conversations at
[work](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/) and (perversely but predictably) by
being compelled to write about other things.

Anyway, please let me know if your blog reading experience is disrupted in any
way.  I've tried hard to keep all of the old links still working, but it's
really easy to make mistakes.

Comments are disabled for now, and possibly forever.  If you think I should
put them back on, please feel free to make your case on the social network of
your choice.
