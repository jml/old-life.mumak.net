Finally, the Launchpad Epic is over. It's been two weeks of very intense activity, with training, workshops, arguments, presentations, lightning talks and pirate costumes.<br /><br />The training was dull but everything else was really good. I did a couple of lightning talks and one full-length presentation, and people seemed to like all them.<br /><br />I'm continually amazed at what a cool company I work for. There are so many smart, competent, interesting people in the same room, actually getting things done.<br /><br />Now I need to figure out how to get to my hostel in Berlin...</div>
