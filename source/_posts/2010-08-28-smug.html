I just wrote a couple of cutting, incisive, witty paragraphs about the use of <a href="http://www.thegenevapush.com/christian-reflections/enormity-means-criminality.html">the word <q>enormity</q></a> that would have struck down all those who dare object to my opinion, which, by-the-by, is so obviously and manifestly correct that those who disagree must exist merely as a dark background on which to project the coloured lights of my intellect.<br /><br />Then I deleted it before posting, because when you argue about English usage, no-one wins.<br /><br />Now, I feel smug for being correct, and smug for doing the right thing. Smuggy, smuglish smugness. How pleasant to start ones weekend with an entirely unjustified sense of superiority and also eggs! Perhaps with those little <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A592481">soldiers</a> and some salt. Hmm, yes.<br /><br />My attention begins to flag, dear reader. Until next time.</div>

Methinks you have been smug for a little too long. Time to write something new. :-P</div>

Although I will probably disagree with your position, or at least feign disagreement for the sake of a good argument, I would like to see those paragraphs.</div>

What IS your opinion? (save the paragraphs just the outcome)</div>
