Last week, Paul preached on <a href="http://www.cbtb.org.au/media/bibletalks/james_119-27/">James 1:19-27</a>. Shows what you can do in under half an hour.<br /><br />It's addressed, naturally, to a church-going audience. Readers who aren't Christians might find it interesting, if not quite as affecting.</div>
