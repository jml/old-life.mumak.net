It's the end of a long, weird and dreary Saturday in London. I'm sitting in the hotel bar, trying hard not to work on my slides. I don't know if I can explain exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> today felt so strange. I think perhaps everything takes on a quirky double life when you are tired under a sky that's boiling apocalyptic grey.<br /><br />So far, the trip's been good. It's energizing being with the rest of <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad">the Launchpad team</a> again. It's the first time this year that we've all been awake at the same time, let alone in the same room. If you've never been to a sprint, it's hard to explain. The buzz is not just from meeting old friends, it's also from the feeling that now we can <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> get down to business.<br /><br />In any case, things have been so busy that I haven't had any time to stop and think, and it's the sort of busy that's not always interesting to report. Right now, I'm going to go back to working on my slides and recuperating: the next week looms.</div>
