I've been feeling pretty rubbish for most of today, and thus won't be posting "Guard" for the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> today. Will be in touch with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice</a> about the necessary forfeits.<div><br /></div><div>In the meantime, I recommend checking out <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/2013/03/guard.html">his "guard" post</a>. I haven't read it yet (I don't read his until after I've written mine), but if past form is anything to go by, then it's definitely worth a read.</div></div>
