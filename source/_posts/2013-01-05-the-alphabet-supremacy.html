<br />I finished up 2012 with a vague intention to write more in 2013. &nbsp;I asked folk&nbsp;on G+ what I could do to turn this vague intention into a more solid reality,&nbsp;and they <a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts/Hi76pkq9C8p">did</a><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts/Hi76pkq9C8p">did not disappoint</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://mary.gardiner.id.au/">Mary Gardiner</a> made some great suggestions, starting with:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The usual: make a public commitment, make a shared commitment, make it a<br />competition, somehow organise it so that your writing is a commitment to<br />another person rather than to yourself.</blockquote>I think these are excellent ideas, so I got in touch with my friend&nbsp;<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>&nbsp;and asked him if we wanted to be my&nbsp;writing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frenemesis&amp;defid=5343186">frenemesis</a>&nbsp;for 2013.<br /><br />He agreed, with his usual aplomb, came back with an idea on how to make it a&nbsp;public and shared commitment, and also a bit of a competition.<br /><br />Here's how it's going to work:<br /><br /><ul><li>Week 1, jml picks a word starting with 'A', we both write something</li><li>Week 2, Bice picks an 'A', we both write something</li><li>Repeat 24 more times, skipping 'X' because no one likes xylophones&nbsp;and because we want Christmas off</li><li>Words aren't restricted to a particular field – anything goes. It must, however, be a single word</li><li>Deadline for posting is 00:00 Monday UTC, the post must also specify the word for next week if it's your turn for it</li><li>Aiming for around 600 words per post</li><li>Each week we put £5 into a pot, if either doesn't publish a post or pick a new word by the&nbsp;deadline, he forfeits the pot to the other</li><li>Whether a post is on topic is judged by general acclamation, and is largely left up to our own consciences</li></ul>I was secretly hoping that this thing with Bice would resolve all of the conflicting awfulness I feel about my current blogging setup, but it was not to be.&nbsp;For the time being, the blog posts will appear on our respective blogs.<br /><br />The first post is due in less than thirty-six hours.&nbsp;I'm pretty excited about it.<br /><br />Also, Mary has written up her excellent suggestions on&nbsp;<a href="http://lecta.puzzling.org/2013/01/01/how-to-do-more-writing-by-someone-who-has-never-made-any-such-resolution/">how do to more writing</a>, and I would urge you to read them if you have a similar resolution.<br /><br /></div>
