What's that word, the one for when people unite to achieve a single goal and spend effort, time, energy, creativity, nous, emotion, money, business cunning and sweat on some grand endeavour?<br /><br />The closest I've got is "industry". It's a shame the word doesn't carry a sense of wonder and verve with it.</div>

I was thinking enterprise too.  Why not endeavour, or venture?  (Star) ship names are good.<BR/><BR/>The only thing I can think of that covers all those qualities is the building of the pyramids, how about pyramidise?</div>

enterprise comes from the French meaning something like 'undertaking'.<BR/><BR/>perhaps this is helpful?</div>

Enterprise is close. The word is used and mocked a lot in IT circles, because it's generally code for "big, bloated and slow".<BR/><BR/>Mission is OK, but doesn't have the grit I want.<BR/><BR/>Maybe I'm just going to have to actually say what I mean, rather than finding a pre-made word for it.</div>
