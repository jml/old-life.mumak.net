I recently finished reading <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">Chris Guillebeau</a>'s "<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/">279 Days to Overnight Success</a>". It's all about how to succeed as a professional blogger. You might want to read it too, since it's quite interesting.<br /><br />It does, however have this unfortunate section where Guillebeau tries to describe <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>' work on <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/">The Fluent Self</a>. The purpose of her blog is hard to grasp at first, he laments. Convinced that there was <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span> there, he visits Brooks' blog again and again, until at last he shouts his euraka:<br /><blockquote>I finally "got" it: Havi helps people rewrite their bad patterns and turn them into good ones.</blockquote>Crystal clear.</div>
