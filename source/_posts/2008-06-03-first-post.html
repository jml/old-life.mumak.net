I'm back in Sydney, <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> back, and I'm happy.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I was in Prague at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. Prague's a great looking city, and I hope I get to back there and explore it and enjoy some more Staropramen.<br /><br />Off to play some Mario Kart with <a href="http://andrew.puzzling.org">Andrew</a>.</div>
