<div style="text-align: center;">UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY PRESENTS<br />A SYDNEY IDEAS LECTURE<br /><span style="font-size:180%;">JOHN MICKLETHWAIT</span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:100%;">Thu 19 June 2008<br /><br /><br />John Micklethwait is the current editor of the Economist â€” a newspaper to which I subscribe. He tried to get us thinking using "provocative paranoia". Sadly, I didn't take notes, so I'll have to dredge my memory for a possible later post.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Cinema 04</span><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Prince Caspian (M)</span><br /><span style="font-size:100%;">Wed 18/06/2008</span><br /><br /><br />Like the Micklethwait lecture, this doesn't have any heroes. Unlike the lecture, it lacks decent villains too. At one point, the chief bad guy <span style="font-style: italic;">swirls his cape menacingly </span>as he steals the throne from Caspian. I spent the whole film thinking about <a href="http://www.crlamppost.org/darkside.htm">Philip Pullman's opinions on Susan</a> and how Edmund seemed along for the ride (except for one awesome moment near the Stone Table).<br /><br />Just read the book: it's cheaper, more enjoyable and won't take much longer than watching the film.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span></div></div></div>
