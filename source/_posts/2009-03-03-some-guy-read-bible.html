And you should too!<br /><br />David Plotz read the Bible and then <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2212616">blogged about it on Slate</a>.<br /><blockquote>After spending a year with the good book, I’ve become a full-on Bible thumper. Everyone should read it—all of it! In fact, the less you believe, the more you should read. Let me explain why, in part by telling how reading the whole Bible has changed me.</blockquote>I'd love to see more honest, informed engagement with the Bible, particularly in Australia.<br /><br />Thanks <a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/crikey/2009/03/03/stuff-we-like-sitting-down-with-the-good-book/">Crikey</a>.</div>
