At Canonical, we normally work in a distributed environment. As such, when we do get together, it's either for intense, multiple day meetings or intense, multiple day hacking sessions. Either way, there's a bunch of useful talk and progress, and this often needs to get written up.<br /><br />While minutes and daily reports are a barrel of fun, for actually <i>doing</i>&nbsp;things and telling others how much you've done, you only really need to record three types of thing:<br /><br /><ol><li>Next Actions – what you're going to do next, and who's going to do it</li><li>Decisions – you've had discussions and come to conclusions, what were they?</li><li>Achievements – things that actually got done during the meeting / hacking session</li></ol><div>You can remember these with the convenient acronym, NADA.</div></div>
