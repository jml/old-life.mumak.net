<div class='post'>
Palmerston North is a strange town. There are three things that single it out from other towns, which I shall enumerate as follows:<br /><br />  1. No one between the age of 25 and 60 has a New Zealand accent.<br />  2. The public library is the coolest place in town.<br />  3. It is ruled entirely by ducks.<br /><br />More later.</div>
