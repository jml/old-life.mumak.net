A couple of weeks ago, Joliette and I got married in the sight of God and men. The day itself is a happy blur in my head, full of smiling friends and family, wonderful food, great music, some very serious words and, of course, her.<br /><br />Right now, I'm sitting in the garden of the flat that we now live in together, catching up on three weeks of work. The flat is still a bit of a work in progress, with empty boxes and piles of junk belonging to the landlord and previous tenants lying around the place, taking up valuable room that we could be using to pile up <i>our</i>&nbsp;junk.<br /><br />It's good be back at work though. I suspect it will get even better when my team mates turn in Argentina and Canada actually wake up.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Happy applause from this side of the pond!  <br /><br />Seeing you is long overdue, and I hope won&#39;t remain that way for long, but in the meantime, congratulations J &amp; J.  It sounds like the wedding was everything a wedding should be, too.<br /><br />Warm wishes,<br />-Karl</div>
