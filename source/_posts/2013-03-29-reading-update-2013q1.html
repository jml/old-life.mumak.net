I'm sitting in <a href="http://www.gladstoneslibrary.org/">Gladstone's Library</a>, a residential library established by the former British prime minister in Hawarden, Wales. There are comfortable chairs, and if I look out the right window I can see snow covered valleys bathed in winter sunlight. Jolie is next to me sketching the room. What better place to share the books I've read this year.<br /><br /><ul><li><i>Getting Things Done</i>, David Allen (reread)</li><li><i>Wild Cards: Aces High</i>, George R. R. Martin, ed.</li><li><i>Solar Labyrinth: Exploring Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun</i>, Robert Borski</li><li><i>The Right Nation: Why America is Different</i>, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge</li><li><i>Moon Over Soho</i>, Ben Aaronovitch</li><li><i>Whispers Under Ground</i>, Ben Aaronovitch</li><li><i>The Daylight War</i>, Peter V. Brett</li><li><i>Will You Be My Facebook Friend</i>, Tim Chester</li><li><i>Crazy Love</i>, Francis Chan</li><li><i>Breakfast of Champions</i>, Kurt Vonnegut (reread)</li><li><i>I Will Teach You To Be Rich</i>, Ramit Sethi</li><li><i>Anna Karenina</i>, Leo Tolstoy</li><li><i>Distrust that Particular Flavor</i>, William Gibson</li></ul><div>I realize I'm late to the party on this one, but <i>Anna Karenina</i>&nbsp;is an amazing book. Even the boring stuff about farming was a pleasure to read. The only thing I didn't like very much was the ending with Levin.</div><div><br /></div></div>

No better way to prejudice me against a film than to have it star Keira Knightley and Jude Law. Hmm, maybe &quot;directed by M. Night Shyamalan&quot; is worse. Anyway, I haven&#39;t seen it, and am not rushing to see it.<br /><br />I guess &#39;too didactic&#39; is a good way of putting it. The amazing thing throughout the book is its psychological realism and Tolstoy&#39;s uncanny empathy for his characters. Two people could be having an awkward conversation, and he somehow conveys both their points of view as well as both sides of what each imagines the other to be thinking. During the final chapter, he abandons all of that, leaving a very likable character to expound Tolstoy&#39;s views on Christianity. It seemed very forced, and reminded me of much that I disliked about <i>War and Peace</i><br /><br />GTD re-read lead to me reinvigorating my collection habit and putting a greater emphasis on making decisions about actions up-front (esp. w/ email). Which was great, until my system got annihilated by starting to work from an office with very strict data security requirements. </div>

Keen to hear what you thought of the recent film: I thought it was a real winner, despite not being a strong drama (!)<br /><br />I haven&#39;t read the book (yet). What didn&#39;t you like about the ending? Too didactic?<br /><br />Also keen to hear what came of your GTD re-read!</div>

I&#39;m reading Anna Karenina right now. Finding it slow going, partly because I&#39;m reading it in a very piecemeal fashion in the tiny pockets of time I have to myself these days, and partly because I chose to read it on our Kindle (I have a complicated relationship with ebooks). The farming stuff is GREAT! And the description of the landscape changing from winter to spring in Part Two is delightful. </div>
