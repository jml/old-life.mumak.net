I'm not a morning person. At all. I really don't like waking up, or indeed doing anything before 11am. Sadly, not being possessed of a fortune and thus able to live life at the mellow tempo of my choosing, I have to put up with it.<br /><br />I've been doing an experiment to see if I can hate waking up less. The idea is to give up coffee and all other drinks with caffeine and see if I can draw from my own latent energy. After all, most of the "buzz" that regular coffee drinkers get is actually the relief of the withdrawal symptoms that they've developed over night. Or so I'm told.<br /><br />Last week I gradually cut down my coffee drinking from "way too much" to "two shots of espresso" to "one shot" and then to no coffee at all. No tea, no coke, no other sources of caffeine besides the occasional square of dark chocolate.<br /><br />I had major headaches on day two of the "two shots" stage, and felt mildly lethargic most of the week. Especially had a great deal of trouble focusing.<br /><br />The weekend was my first "no coffee" days. Mild headaches &amp; severe lethargy. No need to focus. Thanks to a very patient Joliette for two great days.<br /><br />This week, the headaches and the lack of focus have been pretty tough. Today I've been headache free but very much craving a coffee as a way to signal, "right, time to knuckle down &amp; get to it". The focus-fog seems to be worst in the late morning and best in the afternoon.<br /><br />I've also been going to sleep earlier, although I've been doing more exercise, which may be a part of that.<br /><br />I'm still waiting for the day when I bounce right out of bed, eager to face the world, and for a day where my brain focuses like it does on caffeine. I'm hoping the day turns up next week, because I'm definitely going to have a <i>cortado</i> or three when I'm in Barcelona.</div>

I&#39;ve never been a coffee (or tea) drinker, never been a morning person and always struggle to get out of bed. Hate to say it, but you might be waiting a long time.<br /><br />However, I do notice the cortisol buzz that my brain produces about 40 mins after I wake up. So if you can get out of bed with the promise of a warm shower, nice brekkie etc, you should have a bit of bounce by the time you&#39;ve &#39;woken up&#39;. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

If you&#39;ve had a whole week worth of headaches, you&#39;re definitely doing the right thing by cutting back a bit.  If I&#39;m overdoing it, the effect seems to be cumulative; eventually I just start waking up every day with a headache.<br /><br />However, I&#39;ve never experienced the miraculous recovery of energy that some of my peers claim to have discovered upon giving up their preferred form of caffeine (be it coffee, tea, or red bull).  Personally, I&#39;ve given up on going caffeine-free.  I <a href="http://chainsawsuit.com/2011/08/12/coffee-for-addicts/" rel="nofollow">really can&#39;t focus the same way</a> without coffee or at least strong tea at some point during the day.  However, a regulated dosage at particular times of day is a huge improvement over &quot;just drink coffee whenever I feel like it&quot;.  And periodic breaks of a week or so bring down my tolerance level so that it has the desired effect again.</div>

You should be over the worst by now I think.  I think you might be waiting for a while for the &quot;bounce out of bed&quot; thing to kick in though :-)</div>

I feel for you!  I&#39;ve had to do a similar thing recently and it sucks and is awful and i hate it.  But theres something to be said for natural energy (though I&#39;ve got a bit more freedom than you in that my lack of focus just means I lose chess to Xav more and forget my car keys).<br /><br />Decaf feels cheap, but it helps make up for life without coffee a bit:-)</div>

In my experience, I&#39;ve found that cutting out caffeine altogether didn&#39;t make much of a difference -- not having it after a certain point of the day and getting regular exercise has much more of an effect.<br /><br />That one cup in the morning is, for me, the perfect way to say &quot;okay, time to be awake&quot;.</div>

It&#39;s ok to have coffee, although a lot of coffee can cause damage. Head, stomach, teeth and nerves...<br />I think the solution for the morning part is quite natural and I discovered it back in Montreal when the sun would show up at 5am...so at 7am I was feeling like I overslept.<br />Real caffeine would come up 2h after I woke up, at the office, and I&#39;d take like 4 shots of it throughout the whole day.<br />One more fact that helped me a lot was the fact that we would needed to go for a walk to get to the office. So i&#39;d say that when I&#39;m there, I walk for like 8km a day...which helps a lot.<br />Anyways, start with the sun...let it wake you up slowly, and then you&#39;re going to start to feel better and need less caffeine.</div>
