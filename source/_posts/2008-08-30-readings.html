<span style="font-weight: bold;">Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace</span><br />Woah. If you can, get the edition with the foreword by Dave Eggers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lud in the Mist, Hope Mirrlees</span><br />This charming little book lives in the same corner of Faerie as Tolkien's and Dunsany's works. The Other Realm touches on ours during moments of artistic transcendence, and the aristocracy show up and save us all from the merchant class.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf describes the author as "a very self conscious, wilful, prickly and perverse young woman, rather conspicuously well dressed and pretty, with a view of her own about books and style, an aristocratic and conservative tendency in opinion and a corresponding taste for the beautiful and elaborate in literature".<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dragon Waiting, John M. Ford</span><br />Roger Zelazny liked this book, but I don't. The author plays a fun What If? game with history but then bores us with his characters and plot. Of the four main characters, only one is interesting; another plays Ishmael to Richard of York's Ahab and the others are just dreary. Great concept, wasted potential, too many vampires.</div>
