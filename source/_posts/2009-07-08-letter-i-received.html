At my parents&#39; house there were large french windows that were basically sheet glass and as a child I both ran into them when I thought they were open (fortunately they were very solid shop-window glass) and, probably more entertaining for spectators, tried to lean on them when I thought they were shut.</div>

To whom was this letter addressed?  It reads like it&#39;s meant to excuse you from school or something.<br /><br />Glad you&#39;re OK.</div>

Bice, it was completely transparent. Nigh invisible.<br /><br />Mary, yes, it was entirely shattered. We had to replace it immediately since shards of glass sticking out from doorframes are not conducive to household peace of mind.<br /><br />And I honestly did walk into it. No unusual force at all.</div>

I remember this was a big thing when I was a kid, hearing about other kids who had run into/through glass windows and doors.<br /><br />So you walked into it hard enough to smash it?</div>

Open door, then walk through door. I can see how you could forget step 1 I suppose.</div>
