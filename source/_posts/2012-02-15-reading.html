<div>A few quick reflections on my recent reading:</div><div><ul><li>Have decided to apply kanban principles and limit my books in progress and my queue of next books</li><li>Have set myself a rule that I'm not going to start any new books until I've cleared off the ones on my bedside table and the ones in my "In progress" collection on my Kindle</li><li>Just finished "I sleep in haysheds and corners". Some stories are better than others. I particularly liked the opening story for its Tasmaniana and Will Cox's story.</li><li>Also just finished "Why Classical Music Still Matters". Many good ideas, but ultimately disappointing as the author insists on florid prose in the tradition of critical theory. This makes some points impenetrable and others seem like literary word games. Would love to read a book on this topic that was more direct.</li><li>I don't keep a reading log. Benny &amp; Jean-Paul both do, and I was taught to by my old mentor Martin Chance, but I don't. I should. I want to. How does one start so late in the game? What format does one use?</li></ul><div>Also, I'm more active on <a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts">Google</a>+ these days than on my blog. You might want to follow me there.</div></div></div>
