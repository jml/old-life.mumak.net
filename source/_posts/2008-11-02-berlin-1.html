Decisions are funny things. Yesterday, if I had to decide whether to stay a week in a hostel in a foreign city I would have said "No, I want to go home", but I'm here thanks to a decision I made months ago.  We'll see how that one works out.<br /><br />Right now, I'm going to explore the city, perhaps even on an organized tour.</div>

Awesome, I'd love to go to Berlin. Some people think organised tours are tacky and limited. They are, I suppose, but I think you've got to embrace them. They can be an experience in themselves.<BR/><BR/>Hope you're going well over there.</div>
