Because I'm too lazy to figure out how to do a proper reading journal, I'm going to continue to inflict my recent reading on you all.<br /><br />I took a break from the business books that I am supposed to be reading and got into some proper holiday fiction.<br /><ul><li><i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</i>, Laurence Sterne</li><li><i>The Psychopath Test</i>, Jon Ronson</li><li><i>Un Lun Dun</i>, China Miéville</li><li><i>Have His Carcase</i>, Dorothy L. Sayers</li><li><i>Ready Player One</i>, Ernest Cline</li><li><i>Hangman's Holiday</i>, Dorothy L. Sayers</li></ul><div><i>Tristram Shandy</i>&nbsp;soars above the rest of these. I started reading it just as wedding prep got ridiculously stressful. It's pleasant, wafting absurdity was such a welcome escape from logistics, phone calls and bills. I was surprised by how modern it was too. It's as if one is watching a scene in some 18th century English country house, and then Eric Idle pops in wearing an all-white morning suit and starts crooning away.<br /><br />It's similar in place to <i>Tom Jones</i>, mostly in how it has a fair bit of bawdy humour and also not a few addresses to critics. I'm guessing both are functions of the time.<br /><br />Happily, <i>Have His Carcase </i>refers to <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. It's one of the more mysterious of Sayers's mysteries, and a lot of fun. It is very hard not to like Lord Peter Wimsey. He turns up in the short stories in <i>Hangman's Holiday </i>too.<br /><br /><i>Un Lun Dun </i>is the first China Miéville book I've started reading and not immediately hurled at a nearby wall. It's a kids book (not even a "young adult" book), but is fun for all that. <i>Ready Player One</i>&nbsp;is mindless, harmless escapism. It could have done with slightly less geeky wish fulfilment though: at one point, the protagonist is literally playing video games all day, except for when he is using his elite hacker skills to get buff.<br /><br /><i>The Psychopath Test</i>&nbsp;is typical journalist non-fiction.<br /><br />Currently working through some more anthologies of short stories. Now that I'm back from holiday will try to get stuck into my non-fiction books again.</div><div><br /></div></div>
