Last week, I mentioned that I'm on a roster at Christ Church Mayfair. &nbsp;This week, although "protect" too grandiose a word for it, I'd like to share a bit about what it is actually do, and why.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, my job is to keep people out of church, and to make sure that those in the service don't disrupt it. &nbsp;If you think of the role as a bouncer, you wouldn't be too far off.<br /><br />It's not typical for churches to have a rota of bouncers. &nbsp;Generally speaking, we'd like as many people through the door as we can possibly get – we call it "good news" for a reason. &nbsp;Hosting an evening service in central London, however, means that we often get people who turn up who for one reason or another are best turned away.<br /><br />The most common and the most benign are tourists who want to look at the building. &nbsp;CCM is a traditional church building that was built by the Victorians and survived the blitz. &nbsp;It's also the closest churchy looking building to a bunch of very expensive hotels. &nbsp;Plenty of tourists want to have a peek inside. &nbsp;If they want to join the service, they are most welcome, but if they just want to take snapshots of the ceiling, we'd rather they come back some other time.<br /><br />We also occasionally get people who are there with the express intent of disrupting the service, shouting and angry or shouting and mocking as the case may be. &nbsp;Occasionally they're rich lads on a night out, but mostly this comes from rough sleepers with untreated mental illnesses. &nbsp;I really don't know what do for those guys, except to be kind and patient and make sure they don't come inside unless they calm down first.<br /><br />I have to stress, we don't refuse people based on how they look, how rich or poor they are, whether they are on a list (there isn't one) or whether they've been drinking. &nbsp;The basis of admission <i>while a service is running</i> is whether they'll disrupt the service.<br /><br />The last and least pleasant thing that I've had to deal with is men being creeps to women. &nbsp;Once or twice we've had men corner women and make repeated, unwanted advances. &nbsp;At least one such man has freely confessed to using pick-up artist tactics to try to "trick" (his words) women into giving him their phone numbers.<br /><br />The last incident like that happened while I was on duty, and frankly, I didn't know what to do. &nbsp;I tried once to talk to him but he gave me the brush off, so the rest of the evening I stuck to him like glue. &nbsp;Useless. &nbsp;His overall pattern of behaviour was clearly, obviously dodgy but there was no single action I could point to that I could confidently call out. &nbsp;How odd it is to feel bound by social norms while someone else dances on their edge. Should I say something? &nbsp;What should I say? &nbsp;Why isn't she asking for help? Am I white-knighting? &nbsp;What if I tell him to stop and he says 'stop what'? &nbsp;Is there something innocuous I can say to draw him into conversation? Next time – and sadly, there'll probably be a next time – I'll just be rude. It'll probably be a mistake, but at least it'll be a different one.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it. &nbsp;I've focused on the difficult bits, mostly I just end up sitting in the vestibule all evening, opening the door for people as they come in.<br /><br />I should add that this is all very much my own take on things, and whatever resemblance it has to the official stance of Christ Church Mayfair is purely coincidental.<br /><div><br /></div></div>
