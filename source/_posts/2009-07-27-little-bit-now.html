When one says that a thing is a "slippery slope", one is obliged to prove that there is a slope and that it is indeed slippery. Likewise, a thin edge of the wedge is only relevant if there is a substantial "wedge" attached to the thin edge, and if there is some motive force behind said wedge. One might also have to demonstrate that a part of the wedge isn't already in place, and that this is in fact a slightly fatter part of the wedge. In any case, once the wedge is fully driven in (or the end of the slope passed) some calamity ought to follow.<br /><br />In either figure of speech, there are three components:<br /><ol><li>A small movement in a dangerous or negative direction (an implicit instability; the thin edge)<br /></li><li>A near-unstoppable  force in that same direction (lubricated gravity; the implicit hammer)<br /></li><li>A highly dangerous or negative result (crashing at the bottom of the slope; splitting whatever the wedge is in)</li></ol>It's well worth being conscious of each of these components when you use these metaphors. Some examples to consider, many of which are taken from actual arguments:<br /><ul><li>Mandatory Internet filtering</li><li>Allowing papists in the Royal Navy</li><li>Abandoning the Lord's Prayer in Parliament</li><li>Using the proprietary software present in the firmware of a hotel elevator</li><li>Giving money to a beggar</li><li>Nationalizing banks</li><li>Not shaving tomorrow<br /></li></ul></div>

I kinda like to think of the slippery slope ending some great gaping chasm.<br /><br />Either way, calamity awaits.</div>
