I'm moving to London, and soon. I hate moving house. I've done it a lot and each time I do it I still hate it.<br /><br />Here's what I'm aiming for:<br /><ul><li>move out of shared accommodation</li><li>ship some of my stuff to the UK</li><li>keep some of my stuff in luggage</li><li>sell or donate the rest of my stuff</li></ul>I'd dearly love someone to manage all of this for me, and am willing to pay a premium for it. If not, well, I've done it before (except for the UK bit).<br /><br />More info about the move later.</div>

London, baby! Awesome. Whenever you have any hassles with the moving logistics (and I hope that these are minimal), just remind yourself that you&#39;re moving to London. LONDON.</div>

thats both exciting and sad at the same time Jonno (not that we get to see you that much anyway, but it&#39;ll be even less!)<br /><br />Hope all the plans go smoothly aren&#39;t to much of a hassle.</div>

My parents have liked professional packing by removalists when they use it. But I don&#39;t know of anyone who takes care of selling your stuff.</div>

We used http://www.pssremovals.com/ when we moved out to NZ.  We shipped some stuff by air and some by sea.  They did the job, I can&#39;t really think anything positive or negative to say apart from that.</div>
