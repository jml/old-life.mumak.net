I've been thinking more recently about keeping the amount of work I have in progress to a minimum. &nbsp;Having a small number of things on the go at once means that you actually finish those things quicker, and finishing things is great.<br /><br />GTD isn't great at helping me do this, because new projects just go onto my projects list and new actions on my actions list. What I really need is a backlog, a list of projects that are queued up waiting for me to finish one of my current projects.<br /><br />This is a little like the someday/maybe list of GTD, feels at least to me to be conceptually different.<br /><br />Any other personal organization geeks thought about this? Any tips?</div>

I might try some kind of kanban system. <br /><br />Chris, I&#39;m not sure how comfortable I feel about priority.  I might give it a shot though.</div>

I think kanban-style visualisation of what you&#39;ve got in progress as well as in your backlog is great for this.<br /><br />Of course, lots of people are already doing this, things like <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/" rel="nofollow">personal kanban</a> are worth a look.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;m keen to visualise this kind of thing for learning goals... it&#39;s at the top of my list of things to do when I have spare time :)</div>

Hey Jonno, I use RTM for personal to do management, so for me at least it&#39;s fairly easy. I just make the next few things I need to do either priority two or three. Stuff I /have/ to do soon is priority one, and the remainder doesn&#39;t have a priority. As stuff gets done I move the other items up in priority. It might not work if you have heaps of tasks, but I generally have about 250 or so on the go at any time, and it seems to work for me.</div>

I have thought about this <i>quite</i> a bit, and I&#39;ve basically only gotten as far as you have.  I am attentively following any future developments.<br /><br />One of the nice things about my current job is that it has actually restricted the scope of my spare-time activities somewhat, which at first seemed limiting but in retrospect has actually been very helpful.  I have discovered that I have substantially more spare-time hacking than I can ever <i>hope</i> to make any progress on.</div>
