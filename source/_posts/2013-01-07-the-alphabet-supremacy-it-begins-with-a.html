Keen readers of Echo &amp; Bounce will notice two things about the last two posts:<br /><br /><ol><li>they were unusually close together</li><li>neither were about books I've just read</li></ol><div>Although, to be fair, I mention books in one of them.</div><div><br /></div><div>As documented previously, I'm participating in the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>. The first word, picked in an all-too-frequent attack of stupidity by yours truly, was "ambition". My take, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/ambition.html">previously</a>, and <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice's take on his blog</a>. My next word will not be so high falutin.</div><div><br /></div><div>The word for next week, picked by Bice, is "anecdote". I looked it up, and it doesn't mean "a cure for poison", so I'm out of ideas.</div><div><br /></div><div>As Bice <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/2013/01/the-year-of-writing-dangerously.html">mentions</a>, there's no great way to follow both his posts and mine at this stage: no doubt we'll over-engineer a solution some time after the year is out. In the mean time, you probably want to follow him. We'll both try to label our posts with alphabet-supremacy, so you can spot the relevant ones.</div></div>
