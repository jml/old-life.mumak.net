I think about ambition every now and then. &nbsp;It's an important thing in my&nbsp;life and something I dearly wish I could better understand. &nbsp;When I think&nbsp;about it, two people come to mind. Both are fictional, and both are drunks.<br /><br />The first is from <i>Macbeth</i>.&nbsp;When we were studying it, we eventually got to Act 2, Scene 3, where&nbsp;Porter shows up to provide some comic relief for the groundlings.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, &nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />That you do lie so late?<br /><br />Porter&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock: and drink,  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />sir, is a great provoker of three things.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />What three things does drink especially provoke?<br /><br />PORTER &nbsp; <br />Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.<br />Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes<br />the desire, but it takes away the performance: there-<br />fore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator<br />with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets&nbsp;him<br />on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and dis-<br />heartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in<br />conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the<br />lie, leaves him.<br /><br /><br />I don't have many memories of distinct episodes from high school. &nbsp;I can&nbsp;remember the people, and what I learnt, and practically every embarrassing&nbsp;thing I said or did. &nbsp;This hits all three.<br /><br /><br />Our teacher, Mrs Keates, told us (in a fashion I have since learned is common&nbsp;to English teachers everywhere) that this wasn't merely bad comedy but that it&nbsp;had a Deeper Significance. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i>, as it turns out, is a play largely&nbsp;about ambition, perhaps best highlighted in Macbeth's claim that he has "no spur to prick the sides of [his] intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on th'other".<br /><br />And just as a rider who too eagerly tries to mount a horse and falls on the&nbsp;other side, or as a man incited to lasciviousness by too much liquor, the&nbsp;attempt to succeed is doomed to fail.<br /><br />I was a lot younger than the others in my English class, and knew little of&nbsp;lechery or drink. &nbsp;I did know something of ambition however. &nbsp;I wanted to get&nbsp;out of small, dry, dusty Kingaroy, to see the world and to learn everything&nbsp;that it was possible to learn.<br /><br />Because I didn't understand the porter's joke, and because I wanted to learn,&nbsp;I stayed after class to ask Mrs Keates what she was getting at. &nbsp;She&nbsp;explained, and did a fantastic job of masking her amusement. &nbsp;To this day, I&nbsp;can't remember what she said, but I walked away embarrassed and knowing a bit&nbsp;more about lechery and drink than I'd be able to benefit from for some years.<br /><br />I still don't know what to think about <i>Macbeth</i>'s condemnation of ambition,&nbsp;as being entirely free of it doesn't work either. &nbsp;The other fictitious drunk&nbsp;that I was reminded of is Sydney Carton, from <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. &nbsp;His&nbsp;defining trait is his lack of ambition. &nbsp;He wastes away his talents while his&nbsp;boss, Stryver (!), benefits from them. &nbsp;So much so that there's a sense in&nbsp;which his famous last words aren't saying much. &nbsp;Giving his life for Charles&nbsp;Darnay must be a far better thing than he has done, because it's the <i>only&nbsp;</i>thing he has done.<br /><br />I do not want to end with luke-warm Dumbledorizing that too much is&nbsp;bad, and too little bad also. &nbsp;Perhaps ambition is dignified or diminished by&nbsp;its object? &nbsp;There's something in this. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i> shows that any gains you&nbsp;make by striving for the sake of yourself are ultimately hollow. &nbsp;The apostles&nbsp;also frequently warn against "selfish ambition".<br /><br />But to leave it there isn't enough. &nbsp;It's not just the aim of the ambition but&nbsp;the force behind it. &nbsp;Shakespeare also catches on the unruliness of the&nbsp;desire, the way it governs you rather than you it, and leaves you at its&nbsp;mercy.<br /><br />In this, Macbeth and Sydney Carton have something in common, as Carton's crush&nbsp;on Lucie Manette has the same self-defeating properties as Macbeth's ambition.&nbsp;He's consumed by it and rendered powerless by it. &nbsp;Boyish Crush is the lanky&nbsp;nephew of Drunken Lechery.<br /><br />All of which perhaps explain what makes some ambition bad, but doesn't say&nbsp;much about what makes it good. &nbsp;What is it that we admire about the ambition&nbsp;we see in others? &nbsp;In ourselves? &nbsp;How do we prevent our own noble ambitions –&nbsp;if there truly is such a thing – from losing their way and perhaps causing us&nbsp;to lose ours? &nbsp;A lack of time and a lack of insight conspire to prevent me&nbsp;from answering.<br /><br />Shortly after I finished high school, my family left Kingaroy for Tasmania,&nbsp;and in the years since I've seen much of the world. &nbsp;I still don't know&nbsp;everything, but it's something to aim for, right?<br /><div><br /></div></div>
