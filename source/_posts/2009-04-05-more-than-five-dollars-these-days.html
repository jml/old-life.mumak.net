There are so many difficult things in the world: saying sorry, bring peace to the Middle East, adapting books to the big screen, accurately modeling turbulent fluids, wearing orange - I could go on forever.<br /><br />Living in a world full of such difficulties, it's nice to know that there's the occasional, useful accomplishment that's within anyones reach. I speak primarily of making a chocolate thick shake.<br /><br />It's a straightforward drink, elegant in its rich simplicity. To make it, you add chocolate and ice cream to milk and blend thoroughly. You need to be sure that it's <span style="font-style: italic;">chocolate</span> (add chocolate), that it's <span style="font-style: italic;">thick</span> (add ice cream), and that it's <span style="font-style: italic;">shaken</span> (blend thoroughly).<br /><br />Sad to say, even this refuge of culinary ease has its perils. In my wide experience, I've noticed the following:<br /><ul><li>Not chocolate. The give away here is the pale colour, vanilla taste and complete lack of chocolate. Remedy: add chocolate.</li><li>Not thick. A thick shake that's not thick is flavoured milk. Remedy: add ice cream.</li><li>Not shaken. Flavoured milk with unsuckable lumps of ice cream in it. Remedy: blend thoroughly.</li></ul>With diligence, application and a rigorous obedience to the simple principles outlined above, you too can make chocolate thick shakes of excellence.</div>
