That's hardly fair! A blog is for you to disseminate your opinions, you can hardly just post a question without saying anything about what you think. No play fair! :)<BR/><BR/>I think many of those are worryingly true, I guess all are true to some extent.<BR/>I think the purpose of school it to give everyone the same grounding in reading and writing - so that they are more standardised in their base abilities than they were if everyone were educated by their parents, but also because it is more efficient for one person to teach 20 children than for each mother to teach a couple. I suppose that is where schools come from - not the other things, but simply the efficiency of one person doing the teaching while everyone else can get on with other duties.<BR/>As for what it's evolved into today and why do we have schools now... yeah, I guess I'd agree with the author on all those points. It seems a twisted and depressing thing, but there are many social psychology arguments for why homogenisation  to some extent etc is necessary.<BR/><BR/>ElFishski knows more about this than I do, but I don't know if he reads your blog. *shrug*</div>
