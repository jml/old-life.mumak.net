<i>Well, it sort of looks like Homer Simpson, only more dynamic and resourceful</i><br /><br />It seems a silly thing to write about, doesn't it? I'm not entirely sure why I picked it actually. Perhaps it's because both Bice and I have gone through stages of growing our hair out, and I wanted to see how his experiences compared with mine.<br /><br />When I moved to London in '09 after a couple of mostly miserable years in Sydney, I wanted to do something to break with the past, and especially with the suffocating conformity that seemed, at least to me, to pervade the North Shore. Being a polite, risk-averse sort of lad, this was never going to take the form of piercings, eye make-up or tattoos. I wish I had the confidence to do something so bold. I struggle even something as tame as a t-shirt with an actual <i>colour</i>&nbsp;on it. I wasn't (and still amn't) persuaded of my ability to grow a convincing beard, and, well, let's be honest with each other here, very few men's looks are improved by a moustache. Since my imagination then was just as limited as it is now, that left me only with the rather passive option of keeping my wavy tresses away from anything sharp.<br /><br />I've always been a little vain about my hair. Well, maybe more than a little. I can't visit a barber or hairdresser without them commenting on how thick it is, and I've actually had at least one intentionally awful haircut, given by a vindictive barber sporting a comb-over. So as I was growing my hair out, I nursed a secret hope that I'd come to look like some dashing figure from olden times, perhaps like Tristan in Stardust. That didn't work out. Most charitably, I looked like a plump Severus Snape.<br /><br />I grew it out for a year, maybe a little more, never reaching quite long enough to put into a pony tail. The main thing along the way that surprised me—apart from not looking like a Dothraki warrior—was the way it made me feel crappier when waking up. Maybe it's just the weight of the stuff, or perhaps it got in my eyes while I slept. Whatever the cause but I'd wake up feeling even more slothful, resentful and lethargic than I normally do. This was dire.<br /><br />I can't recall exactly what made me decide to have my <a href="http://static.mumak.net/back-before.jpg">dazzling locks</a> shorn from off my scalp. I think that I realized that, for me, what had started as a statement of my individuality had become a kind of flag of surrender, a sign that I couldn't be bothered, that I'd given up on myself. Realizing this wasn't easy, but eventually I cottoned on, and through what I understand to be the grace of God came to embrace life again. After that, getting a haircut seemed like the obvious thing to do, a sort of visible expression of my escape from the Slough of Despond<br /><br />That got way <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI">more serious</a> than I had&nbsp;<span id="goog_1850648565"></span>intended<span id="goog_1850648566"></span><span id="goog_1850648558"></span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>
