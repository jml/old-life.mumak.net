<p>From <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/06/30/1214677946009.html">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/06/30/1214677946009.html</a><br /></p><p></p><blockquote><p>EXTRAORDINARY new powers will allow police to arrest and fine people for "causing annoyance" to World Youth Day participants and permit partial strip searches at hundreds of Sydney sites, beginning today.</p> <p>The laws, which operate until the end of July, have the potential to make a crime of wearing a T-shirt with a message on it, undertaking a <i>Chaser</i>-style stunt, handing out condoms at protests, riding a skateboard or even playing music, critics say.</p></blockquote><p></p>I guess that means my "Mary: Not really all that" t-shirt is staying in the cupboard.</div>
