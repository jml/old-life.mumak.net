Are we staying organized? What's the first habit to go?

Breaking stuff up into @home, @work, @online, @computer, @phone doesn't make any sense for me.</li><li>I don't really feel support from my manager for maintaining the system, even though people appreciate my work "gardening the bug tracker".

It takes ages to get back to actually reviewing the interesting emails and figuring out what I need to do. Then it takes more time to actual do it.<br /></li></ul>I miss the feeling of cleanliness and freedom that I had when I was doing GTD well. It wouldn't surprise me if there are real gaps in the system that I'll be able to understand better once I get back into it.<br /><br />In any case, I'd love to know your thoughts.</div>

Separate desktops would be a pain, and yes, the web 2.0 apps are all terrible in different ways and difficult to evaluate.<BR/><BR/>I think the real benefit of GTD is the way it provides a pattern language for organization: your calendar is not your todo list is not your list of projects etc.<BR/><BR/>I'll be keen to hear how your wiki system evolves.</div>

I only tried GTD for about a week, my major problem was being a user of two separate desktops, necessitating an online or fully synchronised system, and total impatience with signing up for 100 million Web 2.0 sites in order to find a compatible one. (Seriously folks, if I need to do much more than provide my OpenID, at least for an extensive trial, I will not use your web site.) Tomboy didn't cut it.<BR/><BR/>But frankly, I'm so far behind in this headspace. I never even got to the point of being organised with my university lecture notes. I am pretty sure that I did not re-read my notes for any course, ever. I suck at doing this for academic reading too, mostly because... I don't know. I understand writings in a cloud-lie, not sequentially. (This is the reason I have this apparently inexplicable habit of reading almost all books not entirely in page order.) I can do calendars. I can do email. I can usually manage my tasklist in my head even if it does cost in cycles and mood. It's proving problematic with my PhD, for which I am moving to a wiki and hoping I can evolve a system of some variety.</div>

For implementing GTD you might try out this web-based application:<BR/><BR/>http://www.Gtdagenda.com<BR/><BR/>You can use it to manage your goals, projects and tasks, set next actions and contexts, use checklists, schedules and a calendar.<BR/>A mobile version and iCal are available too.<BR/><BR/>Hope you like it.</div>
