My "anywhere", "errands" and "phone" contexts are on my laptop, as well as my "someday/maybe" lists. That means if I don't have my laptop with me, I can't easily churn through my list of phone calls to make. If I do have my laptop with me, which is more likely, it's still a pain to pull it out, open it up and type in my password just to remind myself of whether I need to buy more Vegemite.<br /><br />Possible solutions: paper-based system (yuck!) or some sort of portable electronic device.</div>

What Steve said. <BR/>I like the idea of the swish iPAQs, they're, well, not macs, so when they break you stand a decent chance of prompt and effective support, they run windows mobile nicely (mostly), and i'll bet if you threw enough effort at it they'd probably do linux.<BR/>Aidan keeps saying how cool eee pcs are. Only as far as I can see they have the inconvenience of being too big to hold in one hand easily combined with the inconvenience of small keys. In lieu of a proper laptop I'd go a nice palm top phone.<BR/><BR/>Failing that, I think the iPod Touch probably is a good answer, this just comes back to my problem with Apple service and support. In fact for me it'd be tight between that and paper, and I think paper would probably win, at least you can doodle on paper :)</div>

Yeah, I've thought about getting a Touch for a while. Maybe on my next overseas trip. Maybe.</div>

There's always the iPod Touch -- basically it's an iPhone without the phone bit, afaict.</div>

If I didn't have ~900 AUD to pay out on my current contract, I'd probably have an iPhone already.</div>

Such organisation is the #1 reason I bought a (shudder) windows mobile a bit over a year ago.<BR/>Despite all the (very many) faults, just having a device that goes *everywhere* with me that pops up reminders (usually - see faults) and is pretty easy to get info into is a godsend.<BR/>The book "Time Management for Sysadmins" has some really good stuff on this. Is obvious why I'd have read that book. :-)</div>

I have often had the same thought: the problem then being that I have absolutely no inclination to start paying some phone provider the hundreds of extra dollars per year they'd want over my current phone contract. (I spend about $25/month.)<BR/><BR/>I am waiting for time to provide an economic answer on this one.</div>

I'm counting down the days until you get an iPhone (when I will then start waiting until you start complaining about Apple hardware again).</div>
