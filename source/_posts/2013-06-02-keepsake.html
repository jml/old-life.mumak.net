A tour of a few keepsakes I have.<br /><br /><b>Lizzie</b><br /><br />When my sister Lizzie came back from her honeymoon, she brought me a small wooden carving of a man sitting down, his head tilted to the side and resting on the palm of his hand.<br /><br />He doesn't have any facial features, but I've always imagined him to be quite glum, as if he has spent a long time alone chasing his thoughts and is pretending not to notice that they never go anywhere.<br /><br />When the gift was given, I had felt that way quite a lot of the time for quite a while, and it was about as much fun as it sounds. &nbsp;It's just a little token and it's likely I'm reading way too much into the gift (although maybe not!) but I was quite touched when I received it, and it's sitting on our mantelpiece today.<br /><br /><b>Martin</b><br /><br />My primary school education was a little bit weird. &nbsp;It took a couple of years for everyone to agree that the standard curriculum was doing me more harm than good and to decide what to do about it. &nbsp;In the end, I was taken out of regular classes, became "non-graded" and was assigned to a teacher named Martin Chance. &nbsp;Whichever class he taught, I'd be there in the back, sometimes working with the class but mostly doing something else that he had assigned.<br /><br />He taught me Go, tried valiantly to make me a good chess player, insisted that I read things I didn't like, which at the time included "The Tempest", "A Coral Island" and "War of the Worlds". &nbsp;Where I wanted to focus on maths and programming, Martin insisted on teaching me philosophy, history and geography.<br /><br />Martin became a friend of the family, and after I finished primary school I'd still go over to his place to talk or to mow the lawn or whatever. &nbsp;Although in later years we drifted apart, I still consider him a great friend and can't help but acknowledge the great positive influence he has been in my life.<br /><br />Which is pretty much the reason I keep a small wooden box with a pair of Baoding balls in it.<br /><br /><b>Tilly</b><br /><br />I love my nieces, and probably the worst thing about being an expat is that I only get to see them very rarely. &nbsp;The main reason I still have a Facebook account is because that's the place I'm most likely to find new photos of them.<br /><br />We've yet to receive anything from Georgia, our youngest niece, but if you looked around our flat for long enough you would find a drawing of Aunty Jolie &amp; myself, standing underneath a London rainbow next to some flowers, as well as a cardboard canary, with wings made by cutting around the outlines of a pair of small hands.<br /><br /><b>Bice</b><br /><br />(Ah ha ha! Hoisted by your own petard!)<br /><br />Because sometimes it's okay to conform unthinkingly to your gender stereotype, I haven't owned a fluffy stuffed toy in years. &nbsp;I have Bice to thank for changing that.<br /><br />For a while, I've wanted to own a dog â€“ a big dog, like a Newfoundland Terrier. &nbsp;But for all of that time, I haven't felt as if I could responsibly own one. &nbsp;As a renter, I didn't want to be forced to move somewhere I couldn't have pets and I used to travel quite a lot for work.<br /><br />I explained this to Bice once. &nbsp;The way I put it was that my five year plan was to own a dog, and that getting a mortgage was a step in the middle.<br /><br />I also explained it to Joliette while we were courting each other. &nbsp;It's important to make sure that you have the same priorities before making a commitment, no? &nbsp;She isn't as set on a Newfie as I am, but we are both equally torn between our desire to keep living centrally in London and for a big, slobbering, canine friend.<br /><br />When Bice visited for our wedding, he somehow remembered our offhand conversation, and brought us a plush black Newfoundland, whom Jolie &amp; I promptly christened Mortgage.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

Getting a mortgage in order to own a dog at first sounds silly... but it&#39;s not.</div>
