<br /><b>Disclaimer:</b> I realize that by any sane judgment, my life is so amazingly free of problems that I might as well be cavorting about in the strawberry patches of Elysium, singing counterpoint with the Butterflies of Jubilation that accompany me always. &nbsp;My own knowledge of real trouble, real suffering is so slight that I ought to remain silent on the subject. &nbsp;Yet I hope I have something to say about the more shallow difficulties that we all face.<br /><br /><br />As the philosopher said, shit happens. &nbsp;This life inevitably has difficulty, danger, and disaster, and when these things happen, they don't feel like part of the grand tragi-comic symphony of humanity, they just plain suck.<br /><br />However, if I get to choose how my problems come to me, and I'm choosing based on my<br />own selfish comfort, then deal them to me as one crisis after another.<br /><br />A crisis is obvious, and that's always a good start. &nbsp;We can look at it, and go, "Yep, that's a crisis all right. &nbsp;Better get onto it." &nbsp;The alternative is slow, seeping, dripping problems that we don't notice until it's too late, or worse yet, static ever-present problems that we are only half-conscious of and become a kind of background music of suck, like a television that's on in another room that we can't be bothered to turn off.<br /><br />An example is being overweight. &nbsp;For most of my life, I've been carrying around an unhealthy amount of body fat, and I've always been unhappy about it. (I told you my problems were shallow). As <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/bespoke.html">I mentioned last week</a>, when I moved to the UK I started putting on even more weight. &nbsp;Eventually, I took a couple of weeks off work with the express intent of using the second week to kick off a habit of eating more healthily and doing some exercise. &nbsp;In a sense, I had to force a crisis, and even then it took me years to do so.<br /><br />On the other hand, if I had at some point in my past been thin and then woken up one day with an extra forty kilos of flab, I'm fairly certain I would have take action that same day.<br /><br />There's also a buzz that you get from tackling a crisis. &nbsp;The stakes are high, the clock is running, and every action is weighed with significance. &nbsp;It's not just that we feel like important people doing important things – although it is at least that – but also that our attention is completely engrossed. &nbsp;When a calamity descends upon us while we are in the middle of another, our first reaction is how unfair it is. &nbsp;Perhaps that's partly because we resent the<br />disruption of that perfect, rapt attention? &nbsp;If we handle the crisis well, then there's also a feeling of mastery. &nbsp;We were hit with the worst, but we gave it our best and we came out on top.<br /><br />Even emotional crises have a perverse buzz: it's not for nothing that we speak of "wallowing" in self pity. &nbsp;And even if we avoid that, there's something welcome about the way such a crisis can simplify things. &nbsp;People often say "it makes you realize what's really important".<br /><br />And not only does the crisis make us feel significant and competent, but often it makes others (for a happy moment!) look on us the same way. &nbsp;Someone who averts disaster in the nick of time is a hero, someone who takes a broken, ruined situation and turns it around is a saviour. &nbsp;If we handle a crisis well, we are commended by others – often even if it was a result of our negligence!<br /><br />So for the status, for the mental clarity, for the rush, and because it's much easier than trying to identify and correct any other kind of problem, give me a crisis any day.<br /><br />But please, one at a time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div><b>The Alphabet Supremacy</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>This post would not have happened without the artificially induced crisis brought about by the&nbsp;<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>&nbsp;project that I'm doing with&nbsp;<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.

It&#39;s also worth mentioning where a few of these ideas came from:<br /><br />On attention, <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Confessions</i> by St Augustine, <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allen.<br /><br />On mastery, <i>Drive</i> by Dan Pink (I&#39;ve only watched the animation), <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Creating Passionate Users</i> by Kathy Sierra.<br /><br />On the feeling of significance and the dangers therein, talking to any decent sysadmin.<br /></div>
