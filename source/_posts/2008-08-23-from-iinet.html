I got this in the mail from iiNet.<br /><blockquote>Your payment has been processed.<br /><br />If you are paying by direct debit, please allow up to 4 working days for this transaction to be approved by your bank.<br /><br />    Payment Date: Saturday 23 August 2008<br />    Received from: Mr Jonathan Lange<br />    Amount: $109.00<br />    Payment Method: Automatic CC Debit<br />    Receipt Number: XXXX<br />    Invoice Number: <span class="nfakPe">YYYY</span> ($109.00)<br />    iiNet Limited ABN: ABN 48 068 628 937</blockquote>It's confirmation of a late withdrawal fee. I have <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">never</span></span> withdrawn my application.<br /><br />Is the incompetence or is it actually part of some malevolent plan? I miss Internode.</div>

Sucks.<BR/><BR/>I'm not quite sure why acquiring an internet connection is always such a song and dance.<BR/><BR/>I think it might be one of Anthony J. Crowley's plots to spread low-grade evil.</div>
