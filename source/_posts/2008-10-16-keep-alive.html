Things have been rather busy around here for me. I'm heading off to London for a two-week epic hacking adventure with the rest of my colleagues, and the preparation has taken up all of my free time.<br /><br />Well, not quite <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>. I've also just purchased a <a href="http://www-604.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=10000036&amp;catalogId=-36&amp;langId=036&amp;categoryId=4611686018425096207&amp;seriesid=2060574">new laptop</a> and have been spending a fair bit of time getting it ready to use as a development machine. I'm quite enamoured of its light weight and rugged keyboard.<br /><br />I've also been reading a fair bit:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Economics</span>, The Economist Group</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Master and Commander<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span></span></span>Patrick O'Brian</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fionovar Tapestry</span> (again), Guy Gavriel Kay</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Book of Commonsense Investing</span>, John Bogle<br /></li></ul>And the occasional Gerard Manley Hopkins poem. What I really want is another vast book to lose myself in, like <span style="font-style: italic;">House of Leaves</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Jonathan Strange</span> â€” I guess they don't grow on trees though.</div>

Thanks for the recommendations Benny.<BR/><BR/>I've given up on Neal Stephenson. <I>Cryptonomicon</I> was great, but the follow-up, <I>Quicksilver</I> was pretty terrible from start to finish.<BR/><BR/>I'll have a look at USA though.</div>

You could go for USA, John Dos Passos, or Neal Stephenson, if you like that sort of thing. Or A Suitable Boy.</div>

Thanks Der :)<BR/><BR/>Good idea Bice, it's probably the perfect thing for the long haul flight. I wonder if the bookstore is still open.</div>

I suggest <I>Perdido Street Station</I>. It's not as bad as you think.</div>
