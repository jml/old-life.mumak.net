I applied to iiNet for my Naked DSL line on July the 7th. I still don't have Internet access at home. I won't have it, they say, until next week or the week after.<br /><br />I'll be in Hobart for two weeks from Wednesday afternoon, so I will have waited <span style="font-style:italic;">two months</span> for an Internet connection at my house. That's assuming nothing goes wrong.</div>

Yep. The awesomeness of iiNet's product is inversely proportional to their level of service.</div>
