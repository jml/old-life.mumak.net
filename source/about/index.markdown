There's not much that any of us can do to escape the fact that this is,
ultimately, a personal blog kept by an amateur. It's not a travel blog, food
blog, web-browsing log nor a life chronicle. It's not about any one thing, but
is rather a place to put stories, opinions, reflections and other miscellany
without much in the way of rhyme or reason.

My name is Jonathan Lange.  I'm a colossal geek and love talking shop, but you
won't find much of that here.  If you're at all interested, check out my
technical blog, [Mere Code](http://code.mumak.net).

I read an awful lot: it's one of my chief pleasures in life. As such, I post
quite a lot here about the books I have read. Sometimes, I use this blog
as a reading journal as much as anything else.

I'm a Christian, and try to follow Jesus.  This is not a Christian blog, and
as a rule I try not to be too religious here, since it's hard to write well
about such things.  However, since Jesus is pretty important to me, and since
this _is_ a personal blog, traces of my faith are going to escape.  If you
find Christianity particularly noxious, I can only ask that you please bear
with me.

The title of the blog, _Echo and Bounce_, comes from a tune by
[The Propellerheads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellerheads). Thoughts
and ideas whiz into the author's mostly empty skull, bounce around a bit and
then are echoed back to you.
