Prompted by Francis Lacoste's own experiments, I've recently been trying out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>. The idea is to make a daily to-do list in priority order, and then work down that list. The trick is that for each thing on the list, you spend a whole chunk of an indivisible unit of time – a pomodoro – which lasts for 25 minutes. When that time is up, you take a break. Repeat until the task is finished.<br /><br />I've been pondering how this fits in with GTD. It's easy enough to integrate the technique into a GTD system: each day, you just pick your Pomodoro tasks from your GTD action lists, as Soren points out. How does it integrate with the GTD mental model of personal organization?<br /><br />In the book, Allen scorns the practice of making daily todo lists, noting that they cannot "deal with the volume and variable nature of the average professional's workload". And perhaps he is right.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>When you finish a task in GTD, you go to your current context list and pick a new item</li><li>Causes lag, esp. when in multiple contexts, or if contexts misaligned</li><li>Collection habit is awesome</li><li>Next physical action discipline&nbsp;+ context lists makes things magically happen</li><li>Weekly project review is an essential life skill</li><li>Good tricks</li><ul><li>WF</li><li>Agenda (context works here)</li><li>Phone (context works here)</li></ul><li>Task switch overhead is still pretty high</li><li>Contexts in next action lists don't always exactly align with real contexts</li><ul><li>e.g. Online, but need headphones to watch this talk because you're in a library</li><li>At work, but doing hobby programming at work feels wrong</li><li>You know one task will take three continuous hours, and you don't have that</li></ul><li>A daily todo list ordered by priority, ala pomodoro is more rigid, but reduces that overhead</li></ul><div>Some contexts are better than others. Having a list of phone calls, errands, and things to talk about with certain key people have made all sorts of things happen for me that I probably would never have got around to.</div></div>
