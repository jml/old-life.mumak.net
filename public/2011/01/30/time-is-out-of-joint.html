I mentioned a while ago how it felt like I&#8217;d been living in some pretty big times. Since then, subjective time has been torn out of the shoulder socket of habit and things have been in a bit of a mess. A good mess, but a mess nevertheless. There&#8217;s nothing for it but to recount what&#8217;s happened.<div><br /></div><div>Buckets of fun were had over Christmas. I spent the Eve and the Day with Ian and Rowan, two friends from church who shared a wonderfully family-like Christmas with me. Ro even made a stocking with my name on it. I lost every single board game I played, but there was nice port. I also got a chance to have a video call with most of my Tasmanian family. Funny to think that was the first time I saw my parents in over a year.</div><div><br /></div><div>After that, I returned home and played video games for a week solid, while Joliette and practically everyone else were away. <i>Enslaved </i>is very good, and&nbsp;<i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> is even better, but you probably knew that already.</div><div><br /></div><div>Square-eye fun ended, the new year rolled around and I packed my bags and went to Dallas for three weeks. Now, there are many fine people who live in Dallas, many of whom have been kind to me. But it&#8217;s a hole.</div><div><br /></div><div>Granted, I spent most of the time in a hotel in conference rooms without natural sunlight talking about some of the more arcane aspects of distributed open source software development, but even so, it&#8217;s not one of my top ten favourite cities. In each of <i>those</i>&nbsp;cities, you do not need a car to cross the street.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first week in Dallas was spent doing the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">single geekiest thing</a> that has ever been done in that city. Our old group from Tassie was re-formed, along with special guest James Whelan. My monk kicked arse.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eventually, after both play and work were done, I left Dallas (yay!) and went home to London. Jetlag has thrown the time out of joint in a different way, although if I had more discipline I would recover faster. Returning to kickboxing after six weeks out of practice is an exercise in humility, as was watching some of the clips from my grading session.</div><div><br /></div><div>J &amp; I went to see Hamlet on Wednesday. It&#8217;s my first time watching it on stage, and the first performance J has ever seen. I was very pleased. I had forgotten just how good it is. The production emphasised the constant surveillance of the Danish court, Kinnear played the Dane as a hyper-sensitive introvert who shields himself with wit, and <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/59912/company-members/david-calder.html">Calder</a>&nbsp;did an excellent Polonius.</div><div><br /></div><div>Driving goes well. After warming up a bit I seemed to be as good as I was six weeks ago. Apparently, I&#8217;ve just got to master maneuvres, roundabouts and the motorway before I&#8217;m ready for my test.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, did my first ever yoga class yesterday. I was expecting it to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very flexible. It turned out to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very strong. I&#8217;m surprised that the male yoga practitioners I know don&#8217;t look substantially beefier, to be honest. Also, I hadn&#8217;t expected to break a sweat. Nice that there wasn&#8217;t much of a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; element to that, as there are certain teachings that I cannot submit to nor appear to submit to.</div><div><br /></div><div>That&#8217;s it, I think. Hope all is going well with you.</div></div>
