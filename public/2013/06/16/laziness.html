<br /><br />Seven ways I&#8217;m lazy.<br /><h3>Busyness as excuse</h3>I&#8217;ve been meaning to go to the gym to do some strength training. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, planning for it, and talking about it for weeks, but I haven&#8217;t actually managed to go regularly. Why?<br /><br />The thing that I&#8217;ve been telling myself is that I&#8217;ve got a lot going on already, what with church, kickboxing, a very interesting job, writing these pieces, wanting to spend time with my friends and family, and having many other projects I want to do.<br /><br />In fact, I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve been doing a crappy job with all of these things because it&#8217;s difficult to give them the focus and time that they deserve.<br /><h3>Perfectionism</h3>Regular readers of this blog know very well that I&#8217;m not suffering from crippling perfectionism. &nbsp;I publish a lot of things that are much less good than I&#8217;d like them to be, and quite a few blog posts that I think are fundamentally flawed. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />Even so, I often let the desire for the perfect defeat the good. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s take going to the gym as an example again (it&#8217;s been on my mind). &nbsp;The best time to go is in the afternoon, and there are some dangers associated with heavy lifting in the morning. &nbsp;But going after work would put me in the rush, and going in the middle of the work afternoon would introduce a two hour interruption to my day. &nbsp;So better not to go at all, right?<br /><br />As thin as one-ply tissue paper that&#8217;s just been used.<br /><h3>Lack of structured rest</h3>Resting and relaxing properly is a necessary part of living life to the full. When I don&#8217;t get enough rest, eventually my brain starts working begrudgingly and my body starts to say &#8220;no&#8221;.<br /><br />If I get much less than seven hours sleep, I work much less effectively. Also, it&#8217;s very easy for me to drink enough that everything the next day is significantly harder than it is otherwise.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s always culpable Sloth when I stay up late or when I go out celebrating: life is more than work or duty. &nbsp;But some times I know that the consequence will be a whole day when I need to be productive and all I&#8217;ll be good for is watching cat videos.<br /><h3>Lack of attention</h3>We don&#8217;t fall into attentiveness, we have to pay it. &nbsp;It takes effort, and so much of the time I can&#8217;t be bothered to spend that effort.<br /><br />I really hate it when I do this, because it means doing two things crappily at the same time. &nbsp;I&#8217;m only partly enjoying whatever talk or meeting or conversation I&#8217;m in, and I&#8217;m only partly enjoying whatever email / daydream / conversation / article I&#8217;m distracting myself with. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a real sense in which a lack of attention denies life.<br /><h3>Procrastination</h3>Perhaps the most frequent way I&#8217;m lazy is by always picking the easiest and most pleasurable item on my todo list. &nbsp;I should be doing this thing that&#8217;s important and has a deadline, but that involves something awkward like learning or having a confrontational conversation or getting off the couch, so instead I&#8217;m doing to read this paper on scalable computing that I&#8217;ve been wanting to read for ages.<br /><br />This one is insidious because I can spend a whole day doing productive work, sometimes even work that&#8217;s beneficial to others, but still actually be lazy, because I&#8217;m avoiding things of greater importance or urgency.<br /><h3>Not taking initiative</h3>The canonical example is being out at UDS with a group of people who want to go to dinner but as a mass are entirely incapable of actually making it happen.<br /><br />When I see this happen, I almost always think &#8220;You know, if I just stepped up and took charge, they&#8217;d probably be grateful, and we&#8217;d get to eat sooner.&#8221; And then I think, &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent the whole day talking and listening and explaining and negotiating. &nbsp;Someone else can sort it out.&#8221;<br /><br />Another example: I&#8217;m writing this in Markdown right now. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll then paste it into blogger and then edit it to be formatted correctly. &nbsp;That&#8217;s stupid work for a human being to do, and I really ought to make a machine that does it for me. &nbsp;But that would involve holding myself to a higher standard, and switching into a different mode of work, and &#8230;<br /><h3>Number 7</h3>And you know what, sometimes I simply can&#8217;t be arsed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.
