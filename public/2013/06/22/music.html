When I was child, I never really thought of vanilla as a flavour. &nbsp;Chocolate, strawberry and triple swirl were all obviously real flavours, but vanilla wasn&#8217;t really. &nbsp;It didn&#8217;t even have a colour. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just the flavour of ice cream you use when you don&#8217;t want to be too distracted from the main event, as when eating apple pie.<br /><br />For a long time I used to think of the piano like a bit like vanilla ice cream. &nbsp;Sure it&#8217;s fine in its place, but it&#8217;s just the default instrument. I&#8217;m not sure why anyone would choose it over, say, chocolate&#8212;er, I mean, the cello.<br /><br />But one day I realized that vanilla was more than just the absence of flavour, and that it actually was a pretty good flavour, and how exactly was it to blame if it went so well with everything, and if you don&#8217;t mind I might just have some vanilla ice cream by itself thank you very much. &nbsp;Likewise, I&#8217;m starting to enjoy to listening to the piano for its own sake.<br /><br />Well, a little. &nbsp;One of my favourite pieces of music is Brahms&#8217; Cello Sonata in E Minor. &nbsp;During the last few listens my focus has moved away from the cello and toward the play between the cello and the piano. &nbsp;The dark, strong, forceful line of the cello is the espresso that is both cut and complemented by the (wait for it) vanilla ice cream of the piano. &nbsp;Molto affogato.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know why I like that piece so much. &nbsp;I only picked it up because another piece on the disc is mentioned a lot in The Fionavar Tapestry and I wanted to know what it sounded like. I don&#8217;t like the books quite so much any more &#8211; pick your ice cream metaphor of choice &#8211; but I was entranced by them at the time, and perhaps that enchantment carried over, and when I listen to the sonatas on the album a part of me hears an echo of Pwyll and Loren and the rest.<br /><br />Meh. It&#8217;s just really good music.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

After seeing an amazing live performance a few years back, I&#39;ve become a bit of a fan of Beethoven&#39;s piano sonatas, esp. no.23 &quot;appassionata&quot; </div>
