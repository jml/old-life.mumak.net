<br />I think most readers of this blog have already heard of <a href="http://hpmor.com/"><i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i></a>. It&#8217;s a long-running Harry Potter fanfic where our hero isn&#8217;t the slightly dopey jock aristocrat of Rowling&#8217;s books, but is instead a hyper-intelligent bookish kid with a penchant for logic, reason, the scientific method and world domination.<br /><br />If you haven&#8217;t read it, it&#8217;s perhaps not good enough to bump to the top of your queue, but is certainly a pleasant way of spending a long haul flight. Certainly I&#8217;ve read more than one published work of fiction that was far preachier and much less fun to read.<br /><br />It&#8217;s written by a chap named Eliezer Yudkowsky who helped found <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">Less Wrong</a>, a website notionally aimed at helping you &amp; I be more rational. There&#8217;s some pretty good stuff there, as well as plenty of things to take issue with. Others have done so <a href="http://plover.net/~bonds/cultofbayes.html">much better than I could</a>, but I&#8217;ve yet to read anything to take issue with the thing that bugs me the most: utilitarianism.<br /><br />Their pitch is that a rational agent will (and should? is &#8220;should&#8221; a thing?) choose a course of action most likely to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number. Simple enough, and a useful decision making tool for questions like &#8220;Should I bring a blue cheese or a bottle of wine to dinner?&#8221; or &#8220;Should we compel people to purchase insurance?&#8221;.<br /><br />Harry exemplifies this throughout &#8220;the Methods of Rationality&#8221;. He is remarkably consistent in choosing his actions based on his best understanding of the greatest good for the greatest number. He even has a crisis of conscience when he become unsure of whether carrots are sentient.<br /><br />Except, well, he&#8217;s not. At least, I don&#8217;t think he is.<br /><br />My suspicions were first raised in Azkaban. When Harry visits there and realizes what&#8217;s going on, he reacts with moral fury. Azkaban is not simply irrational, it is simply wrong for human beings to be treated this way. Deontological ethics if ever I heard any. After all, it&#8217;s entirely possible that keeping a subset of humanity locked up in awful conditions will maximize utility, no?<br /><br />But reading up on consequentialist ethics for this piece, I can see a way to restore him to utilitarian purity. Harry&#8217;s objection is not simply that it&#8217;s a prison, but one where <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/62">the prisoners are tortured to death</a>. He reacts with such passion because there&#8217;d be more utility if they weren&#8217;t being tortured, and either he doesn&#8217;t buy the argument that Dementor wardens is the only way to safely guard them, or he thinks that an ineffective prison would be better than such one staffed by Dementors.<br /><br />Even earlier than Azkaban, but only discovered by me while working on this piece, there&#8217;s a scene where <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/47">Draco tries to enlist Harry to aide him against the murderer of Draco&#8217;s mother</a>, who was burnt alive. Harry eventually agrees to make this person his enemy, given five conditions.<br /><br />One of the conditions is that the deal might be off if the killing were a revenge killing. That is, if Narcissa did something awful. Why?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Because then it was still wrong for them to burn her, they still should&#8217;ve just killed her without pain; but it wasn&#8217;t evil the same way as if she was just Lucius&#8217;s love who never did anything herself, like you said.</blockquote>I agree, but my ethics are sloppy and largely deontological. How does it make sense for a utilitarian to decide whether or not to administer justice based on the flavour of evil in the motive?<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, a Google search for &#8220;mens rea utilitarian&#8221; reveals the answer on a <a href="http://quizlet.com/7154997/crim-law-midterm-mens-rea-flash-cards/">criminal law mid-term flash card</a>.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">A person who commits the actus reus [guilty act] of an offense without a mens rea [guilty mind] is not dangerous, could not have been deterred, and is not in need of reform, therefore, their punishment would be counterutilitarian.</blockquote>Perhaps this is what Harry is thinking of. I&#8217;m sceptical though. The language that Harry uses in his negotiations with Draco are clearly not consequentialist, but primarily concerned with doing what is right, and throughout the <i>Methods of Rationality</i>, Yudkowsky freeloads off deontological sentiment while espousing a consequentialist worldview.<br /><br />Even so, it&#8217;s a much more difficult opinion to skewer than I had imagined, which rather sabotages my plans to end this with a glib note about how truly <i>just</i> punishment must be at least partly retributive, per C. S. Lewis&#8217;s essay on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/pro/lewiscs/humanitarian.html">Humanitarian Theory of Punishment</a>.<br /><br />Clearly I&#8217;m going to have to go back to my books and figure out just what I actually think. What a bother.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.
