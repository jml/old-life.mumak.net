The day starts with the sound of the ocean gently, steadily and, alas, digitally getting louder and louder until I can do the sums required to turn it off. &nbsp;It&#8217;s followed by a lot of hot water, a few cuts to the face, a walk past a church cum Indian cultural centre cum Ingress portal before I take a short ride getting way too familiar with the sights and scents of commuters&#8217; armpits. &nbsp;If I took the slightly longer route, I&#8217;d walk past the place Gandhi lived when he was a law student, but I won&#8217;t because it&#8217;s hot and I&#8217;m carrying fifteen pounds of kickboxing gear on my back.<br /><br />Victoria Station is vast and frenetic. &nbsp;Everyone is in the way. &nbsp;It is impossible to not be stressed here. &nbsp;Well, maybe Gandhi could have managed it. I&#8217;m hungry and everything smells of bakery. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t eat much bread these days, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to leap the counter and forcefully grab a half-dozen croissants. &nbsp;The Japanese couple struggling up the stairs with suitcases twice as large as themselves misinterpret my snarl. &nbsp;I really should offer to help, but the moment passes.<br /><br />I shuffle slowly through the Tallest Glass Revolving Doors in Europe, fishing in my pocket for my ID to show to building security. &nbsp;Every time I see any security guards or bouncers these days, I wonder what it would be like to fight them. &nbsp;There&#8217;s one guy here who I reckon would be vicious. &nbsp;He&#8217;s small and looks maybe forty-five or fifty, but he&#8217;s always weirdly alert. &nbsp;When I say &#8220;Good morning&#8221;, he seems to regard it as a distraction from his watch.<br /><br />Once I&#8217;m through, I get to my floor. &nbsp;By now it&#8217;s familiar to me, but I still take the time to appreciate it. &nbsp;The corridors aren&#8217;t just soulless tunnels, but rich, interesting places with colour and texture. &nbsp;The deli &amp; micro-kitchens are cosy and relaxed. &nbsp;My desk maybe technically possibly counts as a cubical, but hasn&#8217;t ever felt that way to me.<br /><br />The first thing I do is get coffee, which Shakespeare would have called the chief nourisher in life&#8217;s feast if he only knew what he was on about. &nbsp;The coffee from the push-button machine isn&#8217;t great, but it works enough to get me ready to use the espresso machine for my sophomore cup.<br /><br />I worked from home for about eight years, in one way or another, and mostly enjoyed it. &nbsp;Now I&#8217;m here, I don&#8217;t miss it at all. &nbsp;Well, sometimes it&#8217;s a bit noisy, but there&#8217;s a beautiful, dark, quiet room where I can escape. &nbsp;The food is better, my computer is better, and the company is better.<br /><br />That is, one of the things I enjoy most about my trade is sitting around with a team, working together on something interesting. &nbsp;At my previous job, even though we worked from home mostly, we&#8217;d occasionally get together in some random city, sit in a room and hack on something for a solid week. &nbsp;Those weeks (NB:&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;the weeks where we sat around planning things) were the most fun times in a job that was overall a pretty fun job. &nbsp;So why not do that all the time?<br /><br />The day starts to wind up, I slug my kickboxing bag over my shoulder and head out. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a different, friendlier security guard on duty, but I only really see his back and I think we&#8217;d both be uncomfortable if I turned around and said &#8220;Good morning&#8221;. &nbsp;I get to Victoria Station, and though it shouldn&#8217;t be mathematically possible there are even more people here, and they all hate me for lugging this great bloody thing around, taking up precious standing room. As I&#8217;m shoved onto the train to Euston, I can&#8217;t help but think that I love this city.<br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">.
