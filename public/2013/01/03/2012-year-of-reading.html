<br />(Skip to the bottom for a tl;dr summary)<br /><br />I read a lot. &nbsp;Reading has always been one of the chief pleasures in my life,&nbsp;and anyone who has spent more than a half hour with me knows that I also rather enjoy talking about what I read.<br /><br />In 2012, inspired by my friends Benny Walter &amp; Jean-Paul Calderone, and my old mentor&nbsp;Martin Chance, I&#8217;ve tried to keep a reading journal. I&#8217;ve kept this journal by&nbsp;inflicting the books I&#8217;ve read on the readers of this blog. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve gone through my posts on this blog, and some other notes about books I haven&#8217;t blogged here, and it turns out that I read sixty-five books in 2012. That is an awful lot of reading, and I think deserves a summary post.<br /><br />What I&#8217;d like to&nbsp;do now is recommend one fiction and one non-fiction book that I&#8217;ve read last&nbsp;year, and call out a few trends in my reading.<br /><h2>Top fiction</h2>I&#8217;ve read so much last year, and if I can take anything away it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s&nbsp;<i>so much</i> that can be done with the written word. &nbsp;My most recent reads,&nbsp;<i>Rivers of London</i>&nbsp;(Ben Aaronovitch) and <i>Invisible Cities</i>&nbsp;(Italo Calvino),&nbsp;brought this home to me. &nbsp;The former is a competently written, fun urban&nbsp;fantasy / police procedural set in London, the second a series of meditations&nbsp;on imagined cities. &nbsp;They are nothing alike, except that they are written and<br />made-up and brought me delight.<br /><br />This makes picking one thing basically impossible. &nbsp;After all, some books go better with&nbsp;some moods. &nbsp;<i>Redshirts</i> (John Scalzi) requires little brain to enjoy, despite&nbsp;being an intelligent book. &nbsp;<i>Peace</i>&nbsp;(Gene Wolfe) on the other hand, is&nbsp;actively out to get you. &nbsp;I found <i>Silas Marner</i>&nbsp;(George Eliot) morally and spiritually&nbsp;challenging, while <i>Gaudy Night</i>&nbsp; (Dorothy Sayers)&nbsp;gave me a few warm, comfortable moments of pretending to&nbsp;have had the Oxford education I always wanted. <br /><br />But, I want to&nbsp;pick just one book. &nbsp;At this point, it&#8217;s a matter of both pride and&nbsp;practicality. &nbsp;I really will go on forever if I don&#8217;t pick something.<br /><br />Ready? Good. &nbsp;Here it is: <i>Gawain and The Green Knight, </i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage.<br /><br /><i>Gawain</i>&nbsp;is an old English poem by an anonymous author. Armitage&#8217;s translation keeps to the&nbsp;alliterative structure of Saxon verse, but uses modern English. &nbsp;Although I&#8217;d&nbsp;read another translation of the poem before, I had never really &#8220;got it&#8221;.&nbsp;Attempts to make great works more accessible can often end with the many&nbsp;excellences of the original being lost. Armitage does just the opposite: he&nbsp;opened <i>Gawain</i> up to me and helped me see what all the fuss is about. &nbsp;Also,&nbsp;it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure to read aloud, has a fun story, and is short. &nbsp;What&nbsp;more could you possibly want?<br /><br />Close runners up include <i>David Copperfield</i> (I figured you&#8217;d already heard of&nbsp;it), <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>&nbsp;(great, but a little too much the kind of book&nbsp;that you read in high school English classes for me to recommend it as <i>the</i>&nbsp;book), <i>The Graveyard Book</i>&nbsp;(perfect, but a children&#8217;s book), and <i>The Fifth&nbsp;Head of Cerberus</i>&nbsp;(disqualified because it&#8217;s a re-read, and because I&#8217;ve&nbsp;yammered enough about Gene Wolfe).<br /><h2>Top non-fiction</h2>In contrast to picking my top novel, this one is easy. &nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel is short, well-written, and on a matter of interest to&nbsp;anyone reading this blog: how the things in our society are changed by being&nbsp;traded in markets.<br /><br />Reading the book challenged my generally positive attitude to free market capitalism and has left me with a more nuanced view. Also, in his carefully&nbsp;defined notion of &#8220;corruption&#8221;, Sandel has given me a new tool for thinking&nbsp;about all sorts of things.<br /><br />Close runners-up include <i>Debt</i>&nbsp;by David Graeber (fascinating explosion ideas&nbsp;that suffer from lack of organization) and <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>&nbsp;by Daniel&nbsp;Kahneman, which would have won, save that the ideas in <i>Thinking</i>&nbsp;were more&nbsp;familiar to me than the ideas in <i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>.<br /><h2>Trends</h2><h3>Kanban</h3>This year I&#8217;ve been applying kanban techniques to my reading. &nbsp;In a nutshell,&nbsp;I limit the number of books I read at once (max 4), and have a very limited&nbsp;selection of books selected to read next (max 9). &nbsp;The &#8220;In Progress&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;Next&#8221; books are very visible.<br /><br />It means I&#8217;m always finishing books, which is a nice feeling. &nbsp;It also means&nbsp;fewer books on the go at once, which in turn means that I can focus better on&nbsp;the books I&#8217;m reading, and feel less guilty about the books I&#8217;m not reading.<br /><br />It also means that when I get a recommendation, I don&#8217;t have to put it at the&nbsp;bottom of a pile, but can make a decision and actually stand a chance of&nbsp;reading it in the next six months.<br /><br />This is very much a nerdy thing to do, but that&#8217;s how I roll.<br /><br /><b>Books with exercises</b><br /><br />I&#8217;ve tried to do more study this year, especially on things that will help my&nbsp;professional development. &nbsp;This has meant reading books that have exercises. They have been&nbsp;rewarding, but they take <i>ages</i>&nbsp;to get through. &nbsp;The kanban system makes&nbsp;it really obvious.<br /><br />Further, I often need to read them at a computer, in a certain state of mind&nbsp;and with a high chance of not being interrupted for an hour or so. &nbsp;That&#8217;s&nbsp;pretty rare.<br /><br /><b>Short stories</b><br /><br />Back when I primarily read paperbacks, I would only very rarely go to a book&nbsp;store and by an anthology of short stories. &nbsp;Now that I use an eBook reader, I&nbsp;read many, many more short stories than I used to.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t expect that, although perhaps I should have. &nbsp;Since I always carry&nbsp;around an ebook reader around, I have much more choice about what to read. &nbsp;I&nbsp;also keep at least one collection of short stories on my phone, in case I&#8217;m&nbsp;stuck without my Kindle.<br /><br />This means that there are plenty more <i>opportunities</i> to read short stories,&nbsp;which seems to mean I read more. &nbsp;This in turn means I get to discover new&nbsp;authors.<br /><h3>Blogging and logging</h3>I&#8217;m not very satisfied with dumping lists of books on my blog. &nbsp;I&#8217;m also&nbsp;unhappy with the reviews I&#8217;ve written, which so rarely do justice to my own&nbsp;opinions and feelings, let alone the books themselves.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to be able to log when I start reading a book, when I finish it, and&nbsp;whether I actually finished it or just gave up. &nbsp;I&#8217;d like to be able to look&nbsp;over books I&#8217;ve read recently and see what genres I&#8217;ve been reading from. &nbsp;I&#8217;d&nbsp;like to do this on something that&#8217;s not a social website. &nbsp;(Do you think I&nbsp;read to be social?)<br /><h2>Overall</h2>I&#8217;m blessed to be able to read and enjoy so many books. &nbsp;As I said earlier, 65&nbsp;books is a lot, and I can&#8217;t help but wonder at what I could have done if I had&nbsp;only read thirty books.<br /><h2>tl;dr</h2><div><br /><ul><li>I read 65+ books in 2012</li><li>Top fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>Gawain and The Green Knight,&nbsp;</i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage</li><li>Top non-fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel</li></ul></div></div>
