<br />A funny thing happened to me the other day. &nbsp;I was sitting on my couch,&nbsp;waiting for an unusually long test run to complete and looking for&nbsp;something to keep me out of trouble when I glanced over at Jolie&#8217;s&nbsp;motorcycle magazine.<br /><br />Jolie doesn&#8217;t normally read motorcycle magazines, or magazines in&nbsp;general really, but she got this particular magazine for a special&nbsp;purpose. &nbsp;You see, she took her bike into the dealer for its MOT the&nbsp;other day and it turns out that everything is wrong with it except the&nbsp;engine. &nbsp;The mechanics say that it&#8217;ll cost so many pounds to replace the parts and&nbsp;the bike only cost a little more than that, so now she&#8217;s in the market for a new bike, and&nbsp;she&#8217;s looking at bike magazines to see what she can get.<br /><br />Anyway, the magazine was open (ever heard that excuse before?), and the&nbsp;page it happens to be open on is an opinion piece called &#8220;Women and the&nbsp;art of riding &#8230; fast&#8221;. &nbsp;There&#8217;s some big text in the middle saying&nbsp;&#8220;Jane Austen couldn&#8217;t have won MotoGP. &nbsp;But maybe soon a woman will come&nbsp;along who can compete at the top.&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;m quite a fan of Jane Austen and&nbsp;hate to see her put down like that. &nbsp;Also, I am intrigued, because&nbsp;everything about bikes that I didn&#8217;t already learn from <i>Zen</i> and the&nbsp;art of same I learned from my wife.<br /><br />Turns out the guy has a claim, that women bikers are fundamentally&nbsp;different to men bikers. &nbsp;He has a lot of stories to back it up, too.&nbsp;Like when he was a kid, other kids said &#8220;chicks dig bikes&#8221; but actually&nbsp;they—the chicks, not the kids—dug cars instead. &nbsp;Or how he asked&nbsp;his wife if she&#8217;d still ride when he died and she said no, it would be&nbsp;too much fuss. &nbsp;Or how some woman win some bike competitions sometimes.&nbsp;Cool stories, no?<br /><br />He goes on to quote his wife saying that women aren&#8217;t evolved to respond&nbsp;to stress with increased vigilance and a readiness to fight, the way&nbsp;that men are. &nbsp;Which kind of clinches it really.<br /><br />The poor guy has to fill a page with text once a month—I feel for&nbsp;him, I really do. &nbsp;I still can&#8217;t help but wish that he&#8217;d have given a&nbsp;local boffin a ring or something. &nbsp;It&#8217;s never going to be Pulitzer&nbsp;material, but at least you could make it look like you&#8217;ve put some&nbsp;effort in. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a rare day that a bit of a think and a quick chat with&nbsp;your spouse is going to challenge your fundamental assumptions about&nbsp;anything, so if you&#8217;re going to write about gender equality as<br />pertaining to competitive motorcycle racing you might as well do a quick&nbsp;search on Wikipedia. &nbsp;You might learn something.<br /><br />Still, it&#8217;s the nature of the genre, isn&#8217;t it? &nbsp;You&#8217;re never going to&nbsp;get cutting edge scientific journalism in the pages of <i>Bike</i>, and even&nbsp;if you did it would still be glued together with warm stories of human&nbsp;interest, as per the standard formula.<br /><br />And then I found a fiver.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: Bargain.</div>
