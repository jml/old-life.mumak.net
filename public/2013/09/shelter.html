			<p>We don&rsquo;t have to read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz"><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em></a>
for long before we get to the fallout shelter.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> spoilers follow.  <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> is a great book, and
it would be a great pity if you were to read this little essay without reading
the book first.  I can&rsquo;t get
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/plugins/">Octopress&rsquo;s excerpt feature</a> to
work yet, so here&rsquo;s the warning again:</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers follow.  Stop reading now.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>When we get there, we discover the remnants of a civilization that managed to
incinerate itself despite all of its wealth, power, and knowledge.  All that
remains within the crumbling concrete structure are bones and a few scraps of
paper.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to say that <em>Canticle</em> is primarily about the question of
where we can find safety &mdash; if anything, it is about the two-edged nature of
knowledge &mdash; but places of refuge are a theme throughout the book, and their
problems mirror the problems of the human condition.</p>

<p>The fallout shelter itself is long, long disused.  When Brother Francis finds
it, he marvels at its engineering and is boggled by its terminology, thinking
perhaps that a fallout is a kind of salamander.  And yet, for all of its
technological wonder, he finds in it the bones of its occupants.  As everyone
who lives after the &ldquo;flame deluge&rdquo; knows, knowledge is not enough to spare one
from destruction.</p>

<p>And yet, Brother Francis belongs to an order of monks dedicated to preserving
the knowledge of the past.  Their abbey guards sacred, original texts – the
Memorabilia – protecting it both from the ravages of time and from an angry
populace that has come to resent all book-learning.</p>

<p>Protecting it also from kings.  Much as in
<a href="http://hpmor.org">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>, the monks
come to believe that scientific knowledge will inevitably be abused by those
with political power.  Thus they are divided, for although they begin by
sheltering this knowledge from a hurt and angry world, they must eventualy do
their best from allowing a greedy, gluttonous world to devour it, and consume
it for its own violent purposes.</p>

<p>Thus, that which shelters also imprisons.  That which makes the abbey a place
of safety for scholars, monks, and ancient texts also makes it an ideal
military outpost.</p>

<p>Even the spiritual safety of the Church is questioned.  Yes, there is much
wisdom there, and a long, long historical perspective that scientists and
politicians seem to lack.  But there is also bickering and infighting, spying
and political intrigue, cowardice and lying.</p>

<p>At one point, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_M._Miller,_Jr.">Miller</a>
refers to a line from G. K. Chesterton.  When asked &ldquo;what is wrong with the
world?&rdquo;, Chesterton replied, &ldquo;I am&rdquo;.  Whether in a monastery or a university
or a parliament or a hermit&rsquo;s hut, we can find no true shelter, for we always
bring the storm within ourselves.</p>

<p>The final parts of the book pit the ultimate forms of shelter against each
other.  On one side, a doctor contends for the merciful sleep of death, where
one is surely safe from the very real suffering in this life.  On the other
side, a priest offers the hope of salvation.  Where should one seek refuge?
In <em>Canticle</em>, Miller raises the question, and leaves us to find our own
answer.</p>
