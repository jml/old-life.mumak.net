			<p>I&rsquo;m hijacking this week&rsquo;s carefully chosen word to talk about changes to the
way I&rsquo;m serving my blogs, but before I get there, have some random musings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny old word, &lsquo;serve&rsquo;.  We use it to talk about another computer, a
server, that does things for your computer, a client.</p>

<p>When we use &ldquo;serve&rdquo; of people, we almost always have a hierarchy in mind.  The
one who serves is lower than the one being served.</p>

<p>And yet, sometimes we grant people the title &ldquo;servant&rdquo; in order to do them
honour.  Thus the most powerful person in Britian is the &ldquo;first servant&rdquo;, or
Prime Minister.  This is perhaps due to a
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010:42-45&amp;version=NIV">Christian legacy</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly with computers on the web, it&rsquo;s this way.  Servers act only on the
initiative of their client, and well run services put the needs of their
clients well ahead of their own.  It&rsquo;s far from a perfect metaphor, since
well-behaved clients do exactly what they are told.</p>

<p>Curiously, the metaphor of the hierarchy is inverted.  While a human servant
is considered below a human master, a computer client invariably downloads
from its server, or pushes <em>up</em> to its server, thus placing the server above
the client.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s happened?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved this blog and <a href="http://code.mumak.net">my technical blog</a> over to
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is a very geeky way of blogging that
allows me to write blog posts using the tools I use to write code.</p>

<h2>Why the change?</h2>

<h3>More fun while writing</h3>

<p>Blogger is nice for what it is, but it&rsquo;s actually a hassle to use for
composition.  It doesn&rsquo;t have rich styles for formatting, doesn&rsquo;t allow
footnotes, and has very poor support for managing literal line breaks, which
is critically important when you are writing about source code.</p>

<p>It has great, built-in support for analysing the traffic that comes to the
site, but that&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s very useful to me.  It turns out, gentle
reader, that you are one of a very select group.</p>

<p>My hope is that by serving my blogs with fresher technologies that I actually
enjoy using, and by lowering the barrier to publication, I&rsquo;ll have something
that is more interesting to me and perhaps more interesting to others.</p>

<h3>Clearer online presence</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at all happy with <a href="http://mumak.net">mumak.net</a>.  I want it to be
focused on my technical and open source interests and to incorporate my
technical blog, currently served from <a href="http://code.mumak.net">code.mumak.net</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://life.mumak.net">life.mumak.net</a> blog and related content would
then move to my halfwise domains, which aren&rsquo;t anywhere near as established.</p>

<p>The hope is that this will let me do a better job with both.</p>

<h3>Ramping up technical presence</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>
project has meant that almost all of my writing time has been devoted to
non-technical things.  It&rsquo;s fun, but my appetite for open source hacking and
for technical writing has been whetted by stimulating conversations at
<a href="http://www.google.com/about/jobs/">work</a> and (perversely but predictably) by
being compelled to write about other things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io/jml/">ThoughtStreams</a> to help get
some of that stuff drafted.  The switch in technologies will make moving that
to my own domains easier.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>

<p>I tried <a href="http://ruhoh.com/">ruhoh</a> initially, but found it to be rather
complicated, and struggled to find themes that I didn&rsquo;t hate.  Some folk
talked about <a href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">liquidluck</a>, which
I would like because it&rsquo;s written in Python and thus more hackable by me, but
after some initial struggles I decided to go with something a little more
popular.</p>

<p>Thus, <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> was the next port of call and so far
seems to have worked out OK.  Perhaps I&rsquo;ll experiment with moving to
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or try liquidluck again.  Now that I&rsquo;m off
blogger and have all of my data in relatively parseable formats, it&rsquo;s much
easier to experiment.</p>

<p>The new blog pages are being served by <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, in a
manner which I do not yet understand.  I picked it because it&rsquo;s free, because
there were
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/">instructions in the octopress documentation</a>,
because I already have github pages and didn&rsquo;t want to bother figuring out
have to have three different site, ad I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to host things
myself anymore.</p>

<h2>What happened to the comments?</h2>

<p>All of the existing comments are still on the site, but new comments are
disabled for now, and possibly forever.  If you think I should put them back
on, please feel free to make your case on the social network of your choice.</p>

<p>Anyway, please let me know if your blog reading experience is disrupted in any
way.  I&rsquo;ve tried hard to keep all of the old links still working, but it&rsquo;s
really easy to make mistakes.</p>
