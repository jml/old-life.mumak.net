The most visceral memory I have of our trip to New York a couple of weeks ago was on a walk Jolie &amp; I took along the Hudson River.<br /><br />Jolie&#8217;s friends recommended a bunch of places for us to go see. We were just coming from one of them, a downtown pizza joint that we were slowly waddling away from, leaving behind a confused server and two-thirds of the one and only pizza we ordered. Never order a pizza in America unless there are at least five people around who are willing to give you a hand.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#8217;re walking down the Hudson, hand-in-hand in the moonlight on our way to a bar that runs in a converted ship, when our path is crossed by this huge rat, just sitting there on the footpath underneath the lights. He didn&#8217;t look like he was doing much, just chilling out on the river, enjoying the breeze.<br /><br />I actually don&#8217;t know if he was huge as rats go, since that&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve seen. At first, I thought it was a slightly bulky chihuahua. When we figured out what it was, I was a bit surprised it wasn&#8217;t busy inducting its turtle friends in the mysteries of ninjitsu. If I&#8217;d known, I would have brought them pizza.<br /><br />All the while, it&#8217;s just sitting there, bold as brass and in no mind to move off the footpath. I hadn&#8217;t been in New York long enough to insist on my right of way, so I navigated us gently around Master Splinter and resumed our night-time amble toward wobbly-decked drinks, glancing over my shoulder very occasionally – only every three seconds or so – to make sure that no rodent horde was pursuing us.<br /><br />I went to New York with a bit of a preconception that the natives were a bit rude, always in a hurry and more than willing to let you know about it. I didn&#8217;t find it that way. The dog-sized rat there was easily the rudest New Yorker we met, and he was surprisingly relaxed for a repellent pest that&#8217;s loathed by all and sundry. I guess he knew there were plenty worse places to be than in Manhattan in the moonlight.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This post is part of the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>, a collaboration with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.
