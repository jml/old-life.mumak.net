I&#8217;m not entirely sure exactly where I&#8217;ve announced it already, but in February I finished up my employment with Canonical.<div><br /></div><div>I started there in January 2007, which means I&#8217;d been with the company over six years. I don&#8217;t know exactly how to categorize these things, but the only other organization that I was involved with for anywhere near as long was primary school, and that just doesn&#8217;t seem to be directly comparable.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had a blast at Canonical, made many good friends, and learned a great deal. I saw much of the world, met crazy, intelligent, interesting, eccentric people, learned how to play Cambridge Standard Five Card Mao, started a few useful side projects and perhaps even made a small contribution to the wider world. I kept being thrown into situations where I&#8217;d have to work with people who were heaps better than me at what they did, and then they&#8217;d graciously and kindly help me get better.</div><div><br /></div><div>And so, making my exit was a bit hard. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know how to do it right, because it&#8217;s been a very long time since I&#8217;ve left a job.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The bit that I didn&#8217;t expect to be hard was pronouns. They are actually still giving me trouble.</div><div><br /></div><div>You see, when I was working at Canonical, <i>we</i>&nbsp;made Launchpad and <i>we </i>were trying to cross the chasm, and <i>we </i>needed to get [whatever] done by [whenever] if we were going to succeed. It&#8217;s all very straight-forward first person plural. There&#8217;s lots of us, and I am one of us, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be</div><div><br /></div><div>Once the notice was handed in, though, I had to start talking about <i>you</i>, at least in the future. That&#8217;s really awkward. Although I&#8217;m still formally one of us, the knowledge that I&#8217;ll soon be one of them breaks <i>we</i>&nbsp;into you<i> </i>and I. To be honest, it just sounded rude.</div><div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Thing is, there&#8217;s something in the oft-made point that you can&#8217;t leave one place without entering another. Every exit is also an entrance. So now I&#8217;m working at <a href="https://www.google.com/">my new job</a>, I&#8217;m facing the same problem in reverse. Occasionally I talk about things that I helped do at Canonical, or even decisions I helped to make, and it&#8217;s very hard not to say <i>we</i>, because in the past it was us who did it. &nbsp;Likewise, when encountering differences there, it&#8217;s hard not say &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how you do things here&#8221; or &#8220;Man, you&#8217;ve got some cool technology&#8221;. So I&#8217;m not quite one of them yet, at least grammatically. I&#8217;m getting there though.</div><div><br /></div><div>The people I&#8217;m working with are fun and very good at what they do. Even apart from the job itself, I&#8217;m learning things from most of them every day. Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be making another exit and leaving the UK to go work with them and some of our US colleagues in Chicago. Despite not looking forward to being away from Jolie for a week, I am looking forward to that. Perhaps I&#8217;ll teach them Cambridge Standard Five-Card Mao.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next week&#8217;s word: fantasy.</div><div><br /></div></div>
