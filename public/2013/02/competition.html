<br />I&#8217;m going to be brutally honest. &nbsp;It&#8217;s 9pm on a Sunday, I&#8217;ve just come in from the cold and the rain, I&#8217;m exhausted from four nights on the trot with little sleep and I&#8217;m in the middle of a good book. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to be sitting here and writing, but I&#8217;m doing it anyway. &nbsp;As much as I want to curl up with a Baileys and some Brahms, I can&#8217;t bring myself to let this deadline pass without some effort to meet it. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to admit defeat.<br /><br />It&#8217;s tempting to add &#8220;not to Bice&#8221; to that, but it would only be for dramatic effect. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve played countless games of many kinds against Bice and have almost certainly lost the majority of them. &nbsp;If there were any shame in losing to him, it&#8217;s a shame to which I&#8217;ve become well accustomed.<br /><br />Setting aside our many rounds of Soul Calibur 2, where I feel that the vast disparity of scores exaggerates the true difference in skill, the games we&#8217;ve mostly competed in have been board games. &nbsp;Long, strategic board games with many players like <i>Civilisation</i>, <i>Risk</i>, or <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Thrones-Board-2nd-Edition/dp/1589947207/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360533882&amp;sr=8-1">Game of Thrones</a></i>.<br /><br />The way it works is like this. &nbsp;Bice, Chris, myself and at least one person named James will gather around a table and set it up. &nbsp;The person named James is sometimes my brother, sometimes my friend James Whelan. &nbsp;The role of the James is to act as my nemesis. &nbsp;If there is more than one James present, then the only difficulty is figuring out what the plural of &#8216;nemesis&#8217; is. &nbsp;Also &#8216;James&#8217;.<br /><br />Before the game, the James will warn the other players against my notorious abilities and to urge them to unite against me. &nbsp;During the opening, they will seize upon my economy of motion and speed of decision making as examples that – unless I&#8217;m stopped by extraordinary means – my victory is certain.<br /><br />Then the game will progress to the middle phase, where at least one James will hurl everything he&#8217;s got at me, sabotaging whatever manoeuvres I had planned and leaving both of our forces greatly diminished and my spirit crushed by the irrationality and the sheer unfairness of it all.<br /><br />Broken now in mind, robbed of strength, and probably never actually being that good in the first place my game quickly crumbles and I&#8217;m soon eliminated. Whichever James attacked me is wiped out shortly after that.<br /><br />Then Chris wins.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m bitter, it&#8217;s not that I mind losing to Chris, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m just convinced that if only I could throw off the shackles of my Jacobion Nemesi (or Nemetical Jameses) I could lose on my own terms in more interesting ways. &nbsp;I enjoy their company (and indeed, &nbsp;competing against them) too much to ever try to exclude them from playing, but I do sometimes hope that maybe this will be the game where Reason rules and I don&#8217;t get ganged up on in the early phases. (OK, I <i>am</i> bitter, but I really don&#8217;t mind losing to Chris)<br /><br />Phew. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been wanting to get that off my chest for a long time. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word is &#8220;door&#8221;.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

Losing to Chris at boardgames is a universal experience, part of the human condition.</div>
