Last year, I read a heap of books. Way too many, probably. One big chunk of this reading was what I like to call a &#8220;rationality binge&#8221;. Spurred by the excellent <i><a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></i>&nbsp;and by <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Crooked-Thinking-Yourself-ebook/dp/B004YD1S1E/ref=tmm_kin_title_0">Straight and Crooked Thinking</a></i>, I&#8217;ve long wanted to get a better grip on rational discourse.<br /><br />This has been amplified by other books I&#8217;ve read that dare to suggest that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Facts-Dangerous-Half-Truths-Total-Nonsense/dp/1591398622/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361362024&amp;sr=8-1">decisions in companies should be based on evidence</a>, and that you should&nbsp;<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">treat your crazy idea for a new product like a hypothesis that needs falsifying</a>.<br /><br />So I guess it&#8217;s not right to say I want a better grip on rational discourse. What I actually want is to help myself and my friends stop wasting their time on things that sound plausible but are actually utter tosh.<br /><br />Amongst our weapons are <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">clarity</a>, <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">logic</a>, <a href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Clear_Thinking/Informal_Fallacies/Tricks/tricks.html">rhetoric</a>, and an almost fanatical devotion to actual data.<br /><br />&#8220;Data&#8221; isn&#8217;t in the classical trivium, but is just as essential as the other three and just as tricky. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow-ebook/dp/B005MJFA2W/">Humans are really bad at thinking statistically</a>&nbsp;and there is <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">more</a> <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">data</a> <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/index.html">out</a> <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/directory">there</a> <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">than</a> ever before.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been trying to work my way through <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats/"><i>Think Stats</i></a>, which came recommended by friends, but I got bogged down trying to work through it in a weird programming language rather than just sticking with the one in the book. Even today, I&#8217;m ashamed that I don&#8217;t really understand&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes&#8217; theorem</a>&nbsp;or its consequences, and embarrassed that Nate Silver&#8217;s work in the recent U.S. election might as well be magic to me.<br /><br />Still, I&#8217;ve been plugging away at it. I now know the difference between a cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study. I kind of, sort of know what statistical significance is, even though I don&#8217;t really have the tools to figure it out. I&#8217;ve been able to read papers on the <a href="http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/2010-12%20ExPUnexpectedSIGKDD.pdf">perils of relying on the results of web experiments</a> and actually follow them.<br /><br />I haven&#8217;t yet had much of a chance to apply these things professionally, but my plan is to skill up (i.e. finish reading through <i>Think Stats</i>), and then apply statistical reasoning to my next couple of personal projects.<br /><br />At the bare bones level of actually <i>gathering </i>data and tracking how it changes, it&#8217;s not too much of an exaggeration to say that it has been life changing.<br /><br />As boring as it sounds, a bunch of numbers in a couple of spreadsheets have been my greatest allies in my constant quest to not be a debt-enslaved fat ass.<br /><br />Left to my natural impulses, I will buy whatever feels good at the time, eat whatever you put in front of me, and then head out later to buy more food to eat. This isn&#8217;t exactly sustainable behaviour. So, for the last little while I&#8217;ve been tracking my spending and recording my weight and such. For my fitness goals I&#8217;ve got fairly detailed records that go back over three years.<br /><br />As proof:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMrje3l0RZs/USTCd1JGyvI/AAAAAAAADXI/oQJ32yXzqts/s1600/Rplot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMrje3l0RZs/USTCd1JGyvI/AAAAAAAADXI/oQJ32yXzqts/s320/Rplot1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Which tells the story that I lost a lot of weight in 2011, have kept most of it off while mostly not caring about weight loss, and have recently started to care again, with okayish results.<br /><br />Because I have to explicitly do work to take the measurements and record them, I only do so when I care, and more often when I&#8217;m feeling good about myself physically. And when I track myself more closely, I tend to be more disciplined about how I eat. &nbsp;Or at least, that&#8217;s what I think. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d go about inferring it from the data.<br /><br />One great thing about having this data for so long a period is that I can set reasonable expectations what progress I&#8217;ll make over the next few months. This gets me excited – I like working toward concrete goals – and will hopefully spare me disappointment. Best of both worlds.<br /><br />I realize that all of this is a bit nerdy, but I can&#8217;t help but think it&#8217;s of fundamental importance. Not me losing weight – that&#8217;s just vanity dressed up as good sense – but measuring things that matter to us, and using that data and our reason to make decisions can only improve the world. <br /><br />But if I, as a dedicated geek with a maths degree, can&#8217;t be bothered working through a basic stats intro book, how can I expect others to do so?<br /><br />Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m afraid that as the tools get better and more data becomes available, a gap will grow between those who are making reality-based decisions and those who are having their decisions made for them.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: exercise.</div>
