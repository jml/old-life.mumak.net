			<p>Somewhat fewer books this quarter, mostly due to wading through <em>Europe</em>, a
massive single-volume tome on Europe&rsquo;s history.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Stranger Things Happen</em>, Kelly Link</li>
<li><em>True Grit</em>, Charles Portis</li>
<li><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em>, Walter M. Miller Jr.</li>
<li><em>The Tyrant&rsquo;s Law</em>, Daniel Abraham</li>
<li><em>The King&rsquo;s Blood</em>, Daniel Abraham</li>
<li><em>The Dragon&rsquo;s Path</em>, Daniel Abraham</li>
<li><em>Europe: A History</em>, Norman Davies</li>
<li><em>Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea</em>, Mark Blyth</li>
<li><em>Broken Homes</em>, Ben Aaronovitch</li>
<li><em>Seasons of War</em>, Daniel Abraham</li>
<li><em>Shadow and Betrayal</em>, Daniel Abraham</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two Daniel Abraham books are published as four separate volumes in
the US.  His books are really enjoyable and intelligent, and if you are into
Joe Abercrombie, Peter Brett, George R. R. Martin, or Robin Hobb, you&rsquo;ll
probably like them.</p>

<p><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> is funny, thoughtful, and a classic use of science
fiction to question our society and our human nature.</p>

<p><em>True Grit</em> is wonderful, but the Coen brothers&#8217; film is so faithful that I
felt like I was reading an echo.</p>

<p>Ben Aaronovitch continues to amuse.  There should be more high quality,
London-based fantasy police procedurals.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to shut up about <em>Austerity</em>, largely because I&rsquo;ve needed
to talk to process the ideas.  It basically changed my ideas about cutting
government spending, and has dispelled whatever lingering suspicions I had
that a gold standard would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I started reading <em>Don Quixote</em> but am making slow, slow progress.  It&rsquo;s
episodic, so I&rsquo;m happy to dip in and out of it.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2013/09/thumb.html">Thumb</a></h1>
		<time>29 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>[Warning: contains fictional depictions of supernatural violence]</p>

<p>Another day, another deadline.  You&rsquo;d think that a world-spanning company
would have figured out a way to its employees get out the door before
midnight.  As it is, I&rsquo;ve barely made it for the last tube.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s oddly quiet.  Normally at Holborn there&rsquo;d be at least a couple of people
waiting on the platform, but tonight there&rsquo;s no one.  The next train isn&rsquo;t for
another six minutes, so I sit down on the bench and pull out my book, a
second-hand anthology of Marlowe&rsquo;s plays.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m flicking through, trying to figure out which characters are supposed to be
on stage in this scene, when I get this stabbing pain in my right thumb, like
someone pushed a needle through my skin right through to the bone.  Blood has
smeared on the page of the book, and when I turn my hand around, a tiny sphere
has formed on my thumb tip.  It&rsquo;s bigger than it ought to be.  I wrap my
t-shirt around it, compressing the wound.  It hurts like a bruise that&rsquo;s been
focused to a single point.</p>

<p>Apart from the blood, the page looks fine.  No spikes, needles or dangerous
insects, just Henry lamenting his poor Gaveston, again.  The train is still
six minutes away.  My thumb still aches, and I&rsquo;m not really sure what I&rsquo;m
supposed to do, so I just sit there and wait for my train.</p>

<p>After another minute, I feel a needle in my left thumb.  It&rsquo;s different from
the right, slower, more malicious.  My whole body tenses with the pain, and I
bite my lip to stop myself whimpering.  It&rsquo;s driving all the way through to
the bone, each millimetre a new lesson in hurt.  What is this?  Some sort of
voodoo?  I haven&rsquo;t made any enemies recently, I don&rsquo;t think, and I simply
don&rsquo;t know anyone who&rsquo;s this cruel.  When it reaches the bone, it scrapes
around a little and then rests. The board still says six minutes.  Why won&rsquo;t
the damn train show up?</p>

<p>I clumsily shove my book back into my bag using the heels of my palms, and
ball my thumbs in my fists wrapped around the bottom of my t-shirt.  The
bleeding&rsquo;s not that bad, but the pain is driving me to distraction.  I want to
cry.</p>

<p>Then I hear it.  Not the train, but a set of slow, steady footsteps.  Hard
leather shoes rapping against a concrete floor.  They should be coming down
the stairs, but they sound as if they are approaching from a corridor.  They
are coming closer, not hurried at all.  I&rsquo;m know I&rsquo;m tired and sore and
confused, but I can&rsquo;t help but think that whoever is walking knows I&rsquo;m here,
and that they are coming for me.</p>

<p>I stand up, my hands still buried in my t-shirt, and watch the platform
entrance.  The footsteps are coming from there, and that&rsquo;s the only way out.
It is almost here.</p>

<p>A figure steps out, elegantly dressed, and walking calmly toward me.  I don&rsquo;t
recognize the face, but when I look into its eyes, I see something horribly,
terrifyingly familiar.  It smiles at me, and as it opens its mouth &mdash; to
speak? &mdash; the last train hurtles into the station, making a noise like the end
of the world.</p>

		<h1><a href="/2013/09/shelter.html">Shelter</a></h1>
		<time>22 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>We don&rsquo;t have to read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz"><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em></a>
for long before we get to the fallout shelter.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> spoilers follow.  <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> is a great book, and
it would be a great pity if you were to read this little essay without reading
the book first.  I can&rsquo;t get
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/plugins/">Octopress&rsquo;s excerpt feature</a> to
work yet, so here&rsquo;s the warning again:</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers follow.  Stop reading now.</strong></p>

<hr />

<!--more-->


<p>When we get there, we discover the remnants of a civilization that managed to
incinerate itself despite all of its wealth, power, and knowledge.  All that
remains within the crumbling concrete structure are bones and a few scraps of
paper.</p>

<p>It would not be fair to say that <em>Canticle</em> is primarily about the question of
where we can find safety &mdash; if anything, it is about the two-edged nature of
knowledge &mdash; but places of refuge are a theme throughout the book, and their
problems mirror the problems of the human condition.</p>

<p>The fallout shelter itself is long, long disused.  When Brother Francis finds
it, he marvels at its engineering and is boggled by its terminology, thinking
perhaps that a fallout is a kind of salamander.  And yet, for all of its
technological wonder, he finds in it the bones of its occupants.  As everyone
who lives after the &ldquo;flame deluge&rdquo; knows, knowledge is not enough to spare one
from destruction.</p>

<p>And yet, Brother Francis belongs to an order of monks dedicated to preserving
the knowledge of the past.  Their abbey guards sacred, original texts – the
Memorabilia – protecting it both from the ravages of time and from an angry
populace that has come to resent all book-learning.</p>

<p>Protecting it also from kings.  Much as in
<a href="http://hpmor.org">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>, the monks
come to believe that scientific knowledge will inevitably be abused by those
with political power.  Thus they are divided, for although they begin by
sheltering this knowledge from a hurt and angry world, they must eventualy do
their best from allowing a greedy, gluttonous world to devour it, and consume
it for its own violent purposes.</p>

<p>Thus, that which shelters also imprisons.  That which makes the abbey a place
of safety for scholars, monks, and ancient texts also makes it an ideal
military outpost.</p>

<p>Even the spiritual safety of the Church is questioned.  Yes, there is much
wisdom there, and a long, long historical perspective that scientists and
politicians seem to lack.  But there is also bickering and infighting, spying
and political intrigue, cowardice and lying.</p>

<p>At one point, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_M._Miller,_Jr.">Miller</a>
refers to a line from G. K. Chesterton.  When asked &ldquo;what is wrong with the
world?&rdquo;, Chesterton replied, &ldquo;I am&rdquo;.  Whether in a monastery or a university
or a parliament or a hermit&rsquo;s hut, we can find no true shelter, for we always
bring the storm within ourselves.</p>

<p>The final parts of the book pit the ultimate forms of shelter against each
other.  On one side, a doctor contends for the merciful sleep of death, where
one is surely safe from the very real suffering in this life.  On the other
side, a priest offers the hope of salvation.  Where should one seek refuge?
In <em>Canticle</em>, Miller raises the question, and leaves us to find our own
answer.</p>

		<time>15 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I&rsquo;m hijacking this week&rsquo;s carefully chosen word to talk about changes to the
way I&rsquo;m serving my blogs, but before I get there, have some random musings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny old word, &lsquo;serve&rsquo;.  We use it to talk about another computer, a
server, that does things for your computer, a client.</p>

<p>When we use &ldquo;serve&rdquo; of people, we almost always have a hierarchy in mind.  The
one who serves is lower than the one being served.</p>

<p>And yet, sometimes we grant people the title &ldquo;servant&rdquo; in order to do them
honour.  Thus the most powerful person in Britian is the &ldquo;first servant&rdquo;, or
Prime Minister.  This is perhaps due to a
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010:42-45&amp;version=NIV">Christian legacy</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly with computers on the web, it&rsquo;s this way.  Servers act only on the
initiative of their client, and well run services put the needs of their
clients well ahead of their own.  It&rsquo;s far from a perfect metaphor, since
well-behaved clients do exactly what they are told.</p>

<p>Curiously, the metaphor of the hierarchy is inverted.  While a human servant
is considered below a human master, a computer client invariably downloads
from its server, or pushes <em>up</em> to its server, thus placing the server above
the client.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s happened?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved this blog and <a href="http://code.mumak.net">my technical blog</a> over to
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which is a very geeky way of blogging that
allows me to write blog posts using the tools I use to write code.</p>

<h2>Why the change?</h2>

<h3>More fun while writing</h3>

<p>Blogger is nice for what it is, but it&rsquo;s actually a hassle to use for
composition.  It doesn&rsquo;t have rich styles for formatting, doesn&rsquo;t allow
footnotes, and has very poor support for managing literal line breaks, which
is critically important when you are writing about source code.</p>

<p>It has great, built-in support for analysing the traffic that comes to the
site, but that&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s very useful to me.  It turns out, gentle
reader, that you are one of a very select group.</p>

<p>My hope is that by serving my blogs with fresher technologies that I actually
enjoy using, and by lowering the barrier to publication, I&rsquo;ll have something
that is more interesting to me and perhaps more interesting to others.</p>

<h3>Clearer online presence</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not at all happy with <a href="http://mumak.net">mumak.net</a>.  I want it to be
focused on my technical and open source interests and to incorporate my
technical blog, currently served from <a href="http://code.mumak.net">code.mumak.net</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://life.mumak.net">life.mumak.net</a> blog and related content would
then move to my halfwise domains, which aren&rsquo;t anywhere near as established.</p>

<p>The hope is that this will let me do a better job with both.</p>

<h3>Ramping up technical presence</h3>

<p>The
<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>
project has meant that almost all of my writing time has been devoted to
non-technical things.  It&rsquo;s fun, but my appetite for open source hacking and
for technical writing has been whetted by stimulating conversations at
<a href="http://www.google.com/about/jobs/">work</a> and (perversely but predictably) by
being compelled to write about other things.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io/jml/">ThoughtStreams</a> to help get
some of that stuff drafted.  The switch in technologies will make moving that
to my own domains easier.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>

<p>I tried <a href="http://ruhoh.com/">ruhoh</a> initially, but found it to be rather
complicated, and struggled to find themes that I didn&rsquo;t hate.  Some folk
talked about <a href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">liquidluck</a>, which
I would like because it&rsquo;s written in Python and thus more hackable by me, but
after some initial struggles I decided to go with something a little more
popular.</p>

<p>Thus, <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> was the next port of call and so far
seems to have worked out OK.  Perhaps I&rsquo;ll experiment with moving to
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or try liquidluck again.  Now that I&rsquo;m off
blogger and have all of my data in relatively parseable formats, it&rsquo;s much
easier to experiment.</p>

<p>The new blog pages are being served by <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, in a
manner which I do not yet understand.  I picked it because it&rsquo;s free, because
there were
<a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/heroku/">instructions in the octopress documentation</a>,
because I already have github pages and didn&rsquo;t want to bother figuring out
have to have three different site, ad I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to host things
myself anymore.</p>

<h2>What happened to the comments?</h2>

<p>All of the existing comments are still on the site, but new comments are
disabled for now, and possibly forever.  If you think I should put them back
on, please feel free to make your case on the social network of your choice.</p>

<p>Anyway, please let me know if your blog reading experience is disrupted in any
way.  I&rsquo;ve tried hard to keep all of the old links still working, but it&rsquo;s
really easy to make mistakes.</p>

		<time>08 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<div class='post'>
The most visceral memory I have of our trip to New York a couple of weeks ago was on a walk Jolie &amp; I took along the Hudson River.<br /><br />Jolie&#8217;s friends recommended a bunch of places for us to go see. We were just coming from one of them, a downtown pizza joint that we were slowly waddling away from, leaving behind a confused server and two-thirds of the one and only pizza we ordered. Never order a pizza in America unless there are at least five people around who are willing to give you a hand.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#8217;re walking down the Hudson, hand-in-hand in the moonlight on our way to a bar that runs in a converted ship, when our path is crossed by this huge rat, just sitting there on the footpath underneath the lights. He didn&#8217;t look like he was doing much, just chilling out on the river, enjoying the breeze.<br /><br />I actually don&#8217;t know if he was huge as rats go, since that&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve seen. At first, I thought it was a slightly bulky chihuahua. When we figured out what it was, I was a bit surprised it wasn&#8217;t busy inducting its turtle friends in the mysteries of ninjitsu. If I&#8217;d known, I would have brought them pizza.<br /><br />All the while, it&#8217;s just sitting there, bold as brass and in no mind to move off the footpath. I hadn&#8217;t been in New York long enough to insist on my right of way, so I navigated us gently around Master Splinter and resumed our night-time amble toward wobbly-decked drinks, glancing over my shoulder very occasionally – only every three seconds or so – to make sure that no rodent horde was pursuing us.<br /><br />I went to New York with a bit of a preconception that the natives were a bit rude, always in a hurry and more than willing to let you know about it. I didn&#8217;t find it that way. The dog-sized rat there was easily the rudest New Yorker we met, and he was surprisingly relaxed for a repellent pest that&#8217;s loathed by all and sundry. I guess he knew there were plenty worse places to be than in Manhattan in the moonlight.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This post is part of the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>, a collaboration with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.

&#8220;Yes, but things are different in the real world.&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s perhaps not <i>the </i>most patronizing thing you can say to someone, but it&#8217;s close to being the most patronizing thing anyone has said to me. (And I am deeply aware, gentle reader, that it is a privilege for me to be able to say so).<br /><br />When I was at school, I was told the real world was and would be different. After I got online, people reminded me that I needed to spend time in the real world. When I went to university, graduates in full-time employment assumed an air of superior knowledge and sagely informed me that the real world was a different place. When I started work and my colleagues found out I was into open source software, they were happy to tell me how that sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t work in the real world. When later I started work at Canonical, more than one person would patiently explain to me that sooner or later the pressures of the real world would cause the company to collapse. Now, at Google, I occasionally hear people joke about how it&#8217;s scary out there in the real world since you have to pay for your food out there.<br /><br />There is exactly one real world. It is the world that we are all living, breathing, eating and sleeping in. We have never in our lives left the real world. Each and every day has been spent within its confines, and it will be so every day until we go to our graves. If it turns out that there is life after that, then that too will be as real as today.<br /><br />Is it possible that the very fabric of the universe shifts and alters at the gates of academia? That friends in the schoolyard mean less than friends in the workplace? Is it really true that being a jerk to someone online is somehow less real than being a jerk to someone standing next to you? Perhaps the laws of physics are suspended at Google, allowing the chefs to conjure food from the ether.<br /><br />No. It&#8217;s very clear what people actually mean when they say &#8220;the real world&#8221;. They mean &#8220;my world&#8221;, and add to it the sheer effrontery of suggesting that only their experience and the experience of those like them has any validity whatsoever.<br /><br />To tell someone that things are different in the real world is to deny them an authentic experience of reality. That which you have lived through is of less value than that which I have lived through. My concerns have weight, yours are ephemeral. My achievements are solid, yours are imagined. I have the boldness to face the truth and all of its harsh consequences, while you wrap yourself in the warm blanket of pleasant delusion. I matter, you do not.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t bear any grudge if you use the phrase to compare and contrast obviously imagined worlds to reality. For example, &#8220;in Tolkien&#8217;s Middle Earth, the Silmarils and later the Rings of Power are central, and the lives of thousands turn on them. In the real world, jewellery is rarely that important&#8221;. If you said that, we might go on to have a spirited discussion about the diamond industry, but I wouldn&#8217;t object to your phrasing.<br /><br />However, if you say something daft like &#8220;Well, all of this open source software is well and good but in the real world we have to think about money&#8221;, then I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to be difficult for us to converse further.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">.

Sometimes I wonder how <i>The Flash</i>&nbsp;can stand it. Not only does he have to struggle through life wearing the world&#8217;s most ridiculous hat, but he must spend subjective aeons of time forced to watch the rest of us faff.<br /><br />Imagine you&#8217;re Barry Allen, aka <i>The Flash</i>, and you&#8217;ve got guests over for dinner. It&#8217;s time for coffee and you realize all of a sudden that you don&#8217;t have any milk. &#8220;No problem&#8221;, you think, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just nip out to the shops and get some&#8221;. After all, you sip from the well of the Speed Force, how long could it possibly take?<br /><br />But on the way down the stairs from your apartment, a large couple have decided to stop on the stair case and have an argument about whether or not they actually did buy bacon when they were out at the supermarket. Now, their conversation takes maybe only fifteen or twenty seconds, but if you can move and react a hundred-thousand times faster than a regular human, then that&#8217;s equivalent to almost a month.<br /><br />Now, I&#8217;m not suggesting that the Flash is stuck in a time stream that moves much, much slower than hours and that he is always watching us continentally drift through our lives. But even so, when he&#8217;s waiting in line at a supermarket, he <i>could </i>by doing something else. In fact, he could be doing, much, much more. For every instant in his stream of consciousness, he is presumably making a decision to not rush ahead and get all of everyone&#8217;s shopping scanned and packed in 7.42s so he can get back to fighting crime or watching Breaking Bad or whatever it is that he actually does. Even if he has some control over how he perceives the flow of time, the crucial thing is that he always <i>knows</i> that he could be going faster if only people would just hurry up a little.<br /><br />It turns out that I am not a patient man, and that I&#8217;m indulging myself by project myself onto DC&#8217;s fastest hero, albeit sans hat. I am all in favour of languorous leisure time, but I see no reason why one should dawdle when filling out forms, and can find no excuse for the person who has waited fifteen minutes in a bank queue only to arrive at the teller entirely unprepared for the experience. There is a time and a place to stop and smell the roses, and it is in a rose garden, not in your local branch of Lloyds TSB. When a dozen people behind you are on the last famished legs of their lunch break, more conscious than ever of their mortality, then one ought to push the tempo.<br /><br />But what an ugly way to live, to be always and ever mildly irked at all the poor souls who haven&#8217;t put as much time and energy into learning the fastest way to use a self-checkout as I have. I don&#8217;t even have to play the &#8220;well, they might have just come from the doctors with terrible news&#8221; game to see it&#8217;s wrong. While it&#8217;s true that you never know what&#8217;s going on in someone&#8217;s head, and that Fundamental Attribution Error is a real thing, and there is only one true judge, that still doesn&#8217;t help me, because that still leaves some people who are slow with no excuse and in my way.<br /><br />What I need to remember are the people who&#8217;ve patiently waited for me to figure things out after I&#8217;ve made the same mistake again &amp; again, the people who&#8217;ve waiting for me to (literally) stop standing on their feet, to (figuratively) stop making an ass of myself, to realize exactly what it was I just said, to say sorry, for me to be sorry.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">.

There&#8217;s really no way to say this without offending some folk, so I&#8217;m going to go ahead and say it straight. Pasta is the Coldplay of the food world: bland, over-played filler squarely aimed at deluding the bourgeoisie into thinking they&#8217;ve got an creative edge.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll admit there are very rare circumstances, a bowl of freshly made pasta with a simple sauce can be a dish to nourish the soul as well as the body. Sadly, these circumstances almost never arrive, and instead we – the people – are forever saddled with squeaky, squishy, off-white starch, passing itself off as a meal. No food should have to pass itself as a bow-tie in order to be eaten.<br /><br />Macaroni &amp; cheese, you say? Jacket potato says I. Lasagne? Why not pizza. Your play is spaghetti bolognese, but I&#8217;ll counter with chicken tikka masala.<br /><br />I&#8217;m coming on strong to make a point. I don&#8217;t actually <i>hate</i>&nbsp;the stuff, and certainly won&#8217;t think less of you if you happen to like pasta. Or Coldplay, even. It&#8217;s just not my scene.<br /><br />Now, although the chances are undoubtedly slimmed after publishing this despicably graceless blog post, if you happen to invite me around for dinner at your place and we end up munching on tagliatelle and listening to <i>Parachutes</i>, I won&#8217;t utter a word of complaint and will eat up everything you deign to put on my plate. I&#8217;m a bigot, not a brute. I would be so gobsmacked with gratitude that mere details as to which starch – musical or nutritional – we choose to fill ourselves with will pale into insignificance.<br /><br />After all – and I am at least eighty percent serious about this – what&#8217;s the point of living if we can&#8217;t enjoy the company of our friends at the dinner table? Cold nights with warm, comforting food (I really don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s pasta, potatoes, polenta, pumpkin or parsnips), enough wine to gently lift the heart and pleasant company to make it all worthwhile.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

		<time>04 August 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<div class='post'>
Last week, I mentioned that I&#8217;m on a roster at Christ Church Mayfair. &nbsp;This week, although &#8220;protect&#8221; too grandiose a word for it, I&#8217;d like to share a bit about what it is actually do, and why.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, my job is to keep people out of church, and to make sure that those in the service don&#8217;t disrupt it. &nbsp;If you think of the role as a bouncer, you wouldn&#8217;t be too far off.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not typical for churches to have a rota of bouncers. &nbsp;Generally speaking, we&#8217;d like as many people through the door as we can possibly get – we call it &#8220;good news&#8221; for a reason. &nbsp;Hosting an evening service in central London, however, means that we often get people who turn up who for one reason or another are best turned away.<br /><br />The most common and the most benign are tourists who want to look at the building. &nbsp;CCM is a traditional church building that was built by the Victorians and survived the blitz. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also the closest churchy looking building to a bunch of very expensive hotels. &nbsp;Plenty of tourists want to have a peek inside. &nbsp;If they want to join the service, they are most welcome, but if they just want to take snapshots of the ceiling, we&#8217;d rather they come back some other time.<br /><br />We also occasionally get people who are there with the express intent of disrupting the service, shouting and angry or shouting and mocking as the case may be. &nbsp;Occasionally they&#8217;re rich lads on a night out, but mostly this comes from rough sleepers with untreated mental illnesses. &nbsp;I really don&#8217;t know what do for those guys, except to be kind and patient and make sure they don&#8217;t come inside unless they calm down first.<br /><br />I have to stress, we don&#8217;t refuse people based on how they look, how rich or poor they are, whether they are on a list (there isn&#8217;t one) or whether they&#8217;ve been drinking. &nbsp;The basis of admission <i>while a service is running</i> is whether they&#8217;ll disrupt the service.<br /><br />The last and least pleasant thing that I&#8217;ve had to deal with is men being creeps to women. &nbsp;Once or twice we&#8217;ve had men corner women and make repeated, unwanted advances. &nbsp;At least one such man has freely confessed to using pick-up artist tactics to try to &#8220;trick&#8221; (his words) women into giving him their phone numbers.<br /><br />The last incident like that happened while I was on duty, and frankly, I didn&#8217;t know what to do. &nbsp;I tried once to talk to him but he gave me the brush off, so the rest of the evening I stuck to him like glue. &nbsp;Useless. &nbsp;His overall pattern of behaviour was clearly, obviously dodgy but there was no single action I could point to that I could confidently call out. &nbsp;How odd it is to feel bound by social norms while someone else dances on their edge. Should I say something? &nbsp;What should I say? &nbsp;Why isn&#8217;t she asking for help? Am I white-knighting? &nbsp;What if I tell him to stop and he says &#8216;stop what&#8217;? &nbsp;Is there something innocuous I can say to draw him into conversation? Next time – and sadly, there&#8217;ll probably be a next time – I&#8217;ll just be rude. It&#8217;ll probably be a mistake, but at least it&#8217;ll be a different one.<br /><br />And that&#8217;s pretty much it. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve focused on the difficult bits, mostly I just end up sitting in the vestibule all evening, opening the door for people as they come in.<br /><br />I should add that this is all very much my own take on things, and whatever resemblance it has to the official stance of Christ Church Mayfair is purely coincidental.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

Phoning this one in, I&#8217;m afraid, since today has been that rarest of occasions: a Sunday almost entirely to myself.<br /><br />My normal Sunday consists of me getting up at around 9am and heading to St Johns church, picking up a coffee on the way. &nbsp;St Johns is an extremely casual church on a housing estate, embedded in some hideous brick skyscrapers. It nominally starts at 11am, but I&#8217;m on a roster often enough to need to be there by 10 or 10:30 a lot of weeks. &nbsp;Jolie&#8217;s always there before 10, grooving away on her bass.<br /><br />By the time the service is finished, and we&#8217;ve done chatting with everyone, it&#8217;s about 1:30pm and we start wandering home. When the weather is even a little bit nice, we walk, since it&#8217;s pleasant and mostly flat. I carry Jolie&#8217;s bass so people will think I&#8217;m cooler than I actually am.<br /><br />Then we get home, and I start bashing out my Alphabet Supremacy piece for the week, Jolie makes us lunch and when all that&#8217;s done we chill out until about 4:30 - 5pm when we leave for the things we&#8217;re rostered on for at Christ Church Mayfair. We don&#8217;t get back from there until around 9:30pm.<br /><br />I do all of that because it&#8217;s important to me. But sometimes, it&#8217;s nice to have a solid chunk of time when I just get things done.<br /><br />Today has provided such an opportunity, as I&#8217;ve been obliged to spend the day at home. It&#8217;s been wonderful. I&#8217;ve been able to do so many dull but essential things like laundry, budgeting (you&#8217;d think that lists of numbers that add up to zero would be less work), a little bit of writing, and a lot of todos that will make the week run smoother for having done them (wedding invitations don&#8217;t become calendar appointments by themselves!).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also had a chance to listen to Das Rheingold for the first time. &nbsp;It&#8217;s really good, and I&#8217;m looking forward to listening to it again and perhaps even <i>watching</i>&nbsp;it, so I can figure out who is singing what.<br /><br />Now the geas which kept me housebound has broken and I&#8217;m off to CCM. Plans won&#8217;t get me back in time to write something more suitable, so you&#8217;ll have to look to Mr Dibley to supply the quality for the week.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">.
