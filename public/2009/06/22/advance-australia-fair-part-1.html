Recently, I&#8217;ve been disappointed to notice myself becoming more patriotic. I don&#8217;t know if this is a result of aging, or a consequence of frequent international travel. I don&#8217;t know whether I should do anything about it, nor even what I would do if I wanted to change.<br /><br />The patriotic fever reached its rabid peak the other day when my rational self caught the other part singing Australia&#8217;s national anthem. I stopped immediately, of course, but the damage had been done. Perhaps the moment of insanity had be triggered by a conversation I had with a friend about immigration and just who we should let into the country. We disagreed.<br /><br />Since then, my mind has been wandering. I&#8217;ve been thinking about a New Australian who desires to indoctrinate themselves our national values, and how they might approach the national anthem, &#8220;Advance Australia Fair&#8221;.<br /><br />To help them along, and maybe to go some way toward resolving the disagreement with my friend, I&#8217;ve decided to go through the Australian national anthem right here, on this blog, line by line.<br /><br />It&#8217;s rather a pompous song, written in a mode of &#8220;poetic&#8221; English that has never been idiomatic and never had any currency among actual poets. Even with my new-found nascent patriotism, I can&#8217;t bring myself to actually <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> it.<br /><br />Here it is:<br /><dl><dt>Australians all let us rejoice,</dt><br /><dd>Be happy Australians!</dd><br /><dt>For we are young and free;</dt><br /><dd>Because our country was founded relatively recently and we have many political freedoms, such as being allowed by our government to watch almost any film and read almost any book.<br /><br /></dd><dt>We&#8217;ve golden soil</dt><br /><dd>Literally, &#8220;we have yellow dirt&#8221;. Either means that Australia is full of the mineral gold, or that our soil is rich. The latter would imply that Australia is an agriculturally prosperous country, and I believe is the sense of the phrase. Note that Australia is the second driest continent in the world, after Antarctica.</dd><br /><dt>and wealth for toil;</dt><br /><dd>If you work hard in Australia, you&#8217;ll get rich.</dd><br /><dt>Our home is girt by sea;</dt><dd><p>&#8220;Girt&#8221; is a rare word for &#8220;surrounded&#8221;. A girdle girts. &#8220;Girth&#8221; is a mostly disused word meaning &#8220;circumference&#8221;. If a thing follows the circumference of another thing, the first thing can be said to &#8220;gird&#8221; the second thing. The second thing is &#8220;girt by&#8221; the first thing. If it spoke plainly, this line would say that Australia is one or more islands.</p> <p>The logic up to this point is that Australians should be happy since we&#8217;re rich, happy, free, young, economically just and &#8230; a bunch of islands. New Zealand, Madagascar, Japan, Great Britain, Iceland and Tonga have never considered this a particular reason for rejoicing. I&#8217;m not exactly sure why Australia does.</p> </dd> <dt>Our land abounds in nature&#8217;s gifts</dt><br /><dd>Our country is full of things we didn&#8217;t put there.</dd><br /><dt>Of beauty rich and rare;</dt><br /><dd>The natural things in our country have a rich beauty, as opposed to a minimalistic beauty, and there are few other things as beautiful as the natural things in Australia. Of course, Australia <i>abounds</i> in them, so they can&#8217;t be that rare.</dd><br /><dt>Let history&#8217;s page in every stage, advance Australia fair</dt><br /><dd>Every time anyone writes about stuff that happened, it should promote the cause of the Australian nation, which is beautiful.</dd><br /><dt>In joyful strains then let us sing</dt><br /><dd>Let&#8217;s sing happy melodies. The composer of the anthem interpreted this metaphorically.</dd><br /><dt>&#8220;Advance Australia Fair&#8221;</dt><br /><dd>&#8220;Australia Fair&#8221; isn&#8217;t a reference to the White Australia policy (I think), but rather a tired &#8220;poetic&#8221; way of saying &#8220;Australia the Beautiful&#8221;. My unsubstantiated hunch is that &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; was already taken, and that it&#8217;s much easier to rhyme with &#8220;fair&#8221; than &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.</dd><dd><br /></dd><dd>Unfortunately, I have no idea what it means.<br /><p> To <i>advance</i> Australia is a nebulous concept, no matter how often we insist that it&#8217;s beautiful. It means literally &#8220;move Australia forward&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t really illuminate the author&#8217;s intent. It can&#8217;t mean move Australia forward <i>spatially</i>: that would be impossible to achieve and to define, no matter how full of zeal one was. It probably doesn&#8217;t mean forward <i>technologically</i> either, since none of the other lyrics acknowledge technology&#8217;s existence. It&#8217;s not morally either, since the author seems to think we&#8217;ve already arrived. It&#8217;s probably either wealth or political influence, but that&#8217;s only speculation.<br /></p> </dd></dl>There you have it. Nothing that bad, but nothing that good either. Mostly it&#8217;s just a meaningless ditty to bang out too slowly and too sincerely at sporting events.<br /><br />At a stretch, you could say that it summarizes something of the Australian spirit. We&#8217;re generally pretty happy and relaxed, united by being in a pretty good country and we&#8217;re lousy at poetry.<br /><br />It&#8217;s still better than God Save The Queen.<br /><br />Next post, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2009/06/advance-australia-fair-part-2.html">next verse</a>.</div>

Hey! from an old xenophobe who doesn&#39;t mind the words of the first stanza of the national anthem. <br />Advance in this context means &quot;make progress in life&quot;. There are plenty of examples of nations that aren&#39;t doing that<br />&quot;golden&quot; often has a dictionary meaning of &quot;inestimable value&quot; (a golden opportunity)<br />And if you think our system of pay for work is a problem, look around the world    <br />To understand the significance of &quot;girt by sea&quot;, think about the defence implications when it was written and the actual implications in Australian 20th century history- the comparison with Britain and the contrast with the mayhem that came from European land border wars <br />For gifts &quot;rich and rare&quot;  take the second dictionary meaning of rare, &quot;Splendid, excellent, fine&quot; <br />But truly, if you think the first stanza is mediocre 19th century poetry of a certain style, cop this lot of the rest of the original words written in 1879<br /><br />When gallant Cook from Albion sailed.<br />To trace wide oceans o&#39;er.<br />True British courage bore him on.<br />Til he landed on our shore<br />Then here he raised Old England&#39;s flag.<br />The standard of the brave.<br />With all her faults we love her still.<br />Britannia rules the wave<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.<br /><br />When other nations of the globe.<br />Behold us from afar,<br />We&#39;ll rise to high renown<br />And shine like our glorious southern star<br />From English soil and Fatherland<br />Scotia and Erin fair<br />Let all combine with heart and hand<br />To Advance Australia fair.<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.<br /><br />Should foreign foe e&#39;er sight our coast.<br />Or dare a foot to land.<br />We&#39;ll rouse to arms like sires of yore<br />To guard our native strand.<br />Britannia then shall surely know,<br />Though oceans roll between<br />Her sons in fair Australia&#39;s land<br />Still keep their courage green.<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.</div>

The impending xenophobia of old age scares me. I don&#39;t know where it comes from, but I&#39;ve recently been thinking once again how much better the whole world would be if all international relations were handled by children between the ages of 4 and 10. Adults suck, they&#39;re too set in their ways to accept other people&#39;s.<br /><br />As for our national anthem, it really isn&#39;t much, and it&#39;s hard to be proud of it as such, but then, I guess it&#39;s not so far off the mark in terms of describing Australia - well, other than the natures gifts bit&#8230; the anthem never mentions that they&#39;re beautiful, but they all want to kill you! :p<br /><br />As for &quot;advancing&quot; Australia the beautiful, I guess it means &quot;put forward&quot;, which you can do in the form of &quot;stick it to them&quot;. Which does explain the fact that we really only associate our anthem with sport!</div>

Well, I have some advantages here: as you say GSTQ is awful, so I&#39;m not likely to hum that, and the NZ anthem hasn&#39;t wormed its way into my brain.<br /><br />Of course the only good national anthem is la Marseillaise, and that&#39;s incredibly xenophobic and violent even by the standards of national anthems.</div>

Ah &quot;girt&quot;.  I rate the rest as pretty mediocre, but &quot;girt&quot; has always delighted me with it&#39;s ridiculous quaintness.<br /><br />Getting on to the second verse will be a better effort than about 90% of Australians.</div>
