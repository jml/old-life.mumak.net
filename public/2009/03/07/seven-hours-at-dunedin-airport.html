The first thing I see when I step off the shuttle bus is a broad, grey, washed-out expanse of floor. The airline staff sit enthroned on their check-in desks, reigning over their empty queues. In the far distance is a wireless hotspot, an ATM and a display cabinet full of prohibited articles.<br /><br />If I cross the expanse to the hotspot, I see fake moa footprints on the floor, leading to some exhibit upstairs. Sitting at the hotspot I can see a to-scale model of the airport in a plexiglass cabinet, rows of maroon chairs facing a wall, automatic massage chairs, the baggage carousel and the escalators. The escalators are always on, but the carousel moves only when a flight arrives.<br /><br />Strangely, the airport is as full of floating dandelion seeds as the city is. They tumble in the air conditioned breeze over the litter that tumbles on the ground. I don&#8217;t know why there are so many dandelions. When I was a child I&#8217;d use to catch them and whisper a wish into them and blow them away. Today I can&#8217;t remember what I wished for, so maybe it came true.<br /><br />Up the escalators, there&#8217;s a small display of the ancient flightless birds that walked the airport grounds long before the first plane arrived. It&#8217;s not very interesting. There&#8217;s a bank, and a news agent that sells only the shiniest of books and a souvenier store. I&#8217;d buy a souvenier, but I have enough black clothes already.<br /><br />The cafes seem built to remind you that you actually do have better places to be. I try sitting there for a bit, but rank boredom and bland hungerlessness drive me to move away. I wander around, trying to find something interesting. There&#8217;s a Koru Club upstairs that I&#8217;ll be refused entry to and a conference centre that will be simply locked. The bookstore still doesn&#8217;t have any Penguin Classics, so I can&#8217;t get the Bronte book I want. I go to the bathroom where I read about launching subprocesses in Haskell and reject two calls to my mobile phone.<br /><br />This last week, I&#8217;ve received several calls from private numbers. Each time the caller has sent me the sound of a phone being hung up as voice mail. The only people I know with private numbers are family members who are afraid of something I don&#8217;t understand. It could be any of them, or it could be a simple glitch in the global roaming phone system. I don&#8217;t care either way, but I wish they&#8217;d stop or leave a message.<br /><br />I&#8217;m tired, and I want to sleep. Soon I&#8217;ll buy something with chocolate in it and something else with words in it and sit with a runny nose being comforted by the chocolate and by someone else&#8217;s imaginary world. First though, I&#8217;ll do one more tour around the airport.</div>

You&#8217;re actually a really good writer, Jonno. Maybe pack in the whole programming thing and concentrate more on sentence crafting :)<BR/>(it&#8217;s what you do anyway, right, just not usually in English).<BR/><BR/>Nice post :)</div>

Great post JML. That took me straight there. I reckon airport bookshops are quite depressing. Racks full of sports magazines and paperbacks of Jodi Picoults and Tom Clancys (at best).</div>

Huw told me this post was worth a read and it was. Rank boredom is such an apt description.</div>
