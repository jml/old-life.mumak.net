I do a fair bit of long-haul air travel. I&#8217;d like to get a decent pair of headphones or earphones or whatever that I can use on the plane.<br /><br />Desirable features:<br /><ul><li>Small (I&#8217;m traveling)<br /></li><li>Robust (<span style="font-style: italic;">I&#8217;m</span> traveling)</li><li>Block out or cancel noise (I&#8217;m traveling <span style="font-style: italic;">economy</span>)</li><li>Comfortable (I&#8217;m traveling economy for about thirty hours door-to-door)</li><li>Work without power source (thirty hours, dammit)</li><li>Plug into those two-prong things they have in planes<br /></li><li>Can be used as a skype headset (this is a bit of a long shot)</li></ul>Any recommendations?</div>

I previously had some Phillips (?) active noise cancelling headphones, but broke them through fitting them in to a carry-on-sized backpack with my other stuff.  They were ok.  Active noise cancellation is certainly a neat trick.<br /><br />Until recently I had some Shure in-ear phones: basically like foam earplugs but with speakers in them.  They have some substantial advantages: they&#8217;re much smaller and lighter, therefore easier to pack without breaking, they don&#8217;t need batteries and cannot run flat, and they arguably sound better.  <br /><br />The noise suppression, being passive, can&#8217;t be turned off so if you use them in an office you won&#8217;t hear voices clearly, which may be either good or bad at different times.  You can leave one of them out as a workaround.<br /><br />They work reasonably well under a motorcycle helmet depending on the space around the ears, though that&#8217;s presumably not an issue for you.  However the flappy cord is annoying, and on my next long trip I&#8217;ll probably try regular plugs plus a bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />If I was going to get earphones again I&#8217;d probably try the Etymotic ER6i.<br /><br />I would also recommend bringing an in-line volume control (~$5), because the in-seat AV source is at a very high level and too loud to listen to with most headphones.</div>

My previous headphones had a physical break last sprint (since repaired) so had a &#8220;ZOMG need headphones&#8221; moment for the trip home.<BR/>Options at Heathrow T4 being limited :-/ picked up some <A HREF="http://www.bose.com.au/site/index.aspx?path=products&ctrl=PG&pfid=10&pgid=32" REL="nofollow">Bose Quiet Comfort 2</A> headphones.<BR/>Not small, but not too bad. Moderately robust - they came with a hardish travel case, and the cups rotate to be flat.<BR/>Plug is removable - so you can sleep with them on - tried and tested. Which also answers the comfort option. :-)<BR/>You can buy those two prong plugs for $5 at DSE - tho istr, I only needed one for the trip out, not back.<BR/>They do significantly reduce (vs eliminate) engine noise, can still hear PA announcements.<BR/>AAA battery powered - lasted the entire trip back (35ish hours) for me and then some.<BR/>And I just discovered that they have a mic option - which I&#8217;m just about to order. Hopefully will arrive in time for my next thumper &#8220;quick call?&#8221; ;-)<BR/><BR/>hth!</div>
