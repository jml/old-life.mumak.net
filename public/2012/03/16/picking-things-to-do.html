<div>I keep a pretty extensive todo list. I don&#8217;t really know if it helps me do more things or be more reliable, but it certainly comforts me.</div><div><br /></div><div>But how do I actually pick items off it? How do I actually decide what to do? Here are a few of the strategies that I use, for better or worse.</div><div><br /></div><div>I apply these strategies only after filtering out items that I simply cannot do because of my current circumstances. e.g. I can&#8217;t make phone calls from the tube.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Meet the deadline</b></div><div>Something needs to be done today, so I&#8217;ll do that. The beauty is its simplicity.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Do something fun</b></div><div>I&#8217;ll look at my todo list and after careful and thoughtful consideration of priorities, time frames, personal responsibilities and life goals, will do whatever I wanted to do in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Shorten the list as much as possible</b></div><div>When I go through the list trying to get rid of as many items as possible, aiming for the shorter and easier ones. Generally happens in a mad panic on a Friday afternoon. The biggest danger is that I make a mistake in guessing how long something will take and end up stuck on one task forever.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Kill the oldest item</b></div><div>This thing has been on my plate <i>forever.</i>&nbsp;If I do it now, I&#8217;ll feel like a Much Better Person.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Finish off one project</b></div><div>Because it&#8217;s cool to reach an actual outcome, rather than eternally making progress. This is almost always impossible to do.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Now or never</b></div><div>If I don&#8217;t do this particular todo right now, I know I&#8217;m never going to come back to it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>While I&#8217;m doing this I might as well&#8230;</b></div><div>Not so much consulting my todo list as letting my mind&#8217;s vagueness and the distractions surrounding one task lead me into another. Often ends up as productive and valuable time spent. I guess I irrationally believe that conscious choices are better, somehow.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Tackle the most daunting task first</b></div><div>Often the oldest item is the most daunting, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I guess I could expand &#8220;most daunting task&#8221; to mean &#8220;the task I find myself thinking about the most&#8221;. Thinking how one should really do a thing after one has already decided to do a thing is a waste of valuable energy, so sometimes it&#8217;s better to just do it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What will I not naturally do?</b></div><div>A lot of the things on my todo list are things that I&#8217;ll get around to in due course anyway. Part of the power-up that a todo list grants is the ability to choose to do things you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise do. These don&#8217;t have to be daunting things, they can be fun, or exploratory, or mundane. Something like writing a small program in an interesting new programming language, or finally getting to grips with what a financial derivative really is. These things often fall into the &#8220;important but not urgent&#8221; category.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Personal utility</b></div><div>What thing can I do that will improve my life the most? I use this one the least, although arguably it is the most rational.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>There&#8217;s some overlap between these categories, but I think they are different enough to be useful to me in improving my self-awareness, and perhaps even in making better decisions about how to use the time God has given me.</div></div>

Heh, I find myself doing all those too.<br /><br />Plus a few others:<br /><br />* It&#39;s something someone recently asked about.  The more people that care about something, the more important it seems to me.<br /><br />* Doing this will enable me to cross of several other items pretty easily.<br /><br />* It&#39;s the type of task that once done, it&#39;s done.  Not one of those tasks that as soon as you finish it, you realize there&#39;s 6 more follow-on tasks that you&#39;ll have to add to your todo list.<br /><br />* I organize my tasks by project, and at the start of the month select one or two projects to work on each day of the month.  So, I&#39;ll try to weight myself towards picking off an item off that project&#39;s todo list.  Still have to go through the whole process of &quot;which task to pick&quot;, but constraining it to the one project makes it a shorter list to pick from.</div>
