I&#8217;ve had several non-fiction burdens in my &#8220;currently reading&#8221; list that I&#8217;ve decided to drop. Farewell &#8220;ggplot2&#8221;, &#8220;Think Stats&#8221; and &#8220;Innovator&#8217;s Solution&#8221;. I won&#8217;t miss you. Maybe I&#8217;ll read you again when I care more urgently about data analysis and launching successful products. Still slogging through &#8220;7 Habits&#8221;.<br /><br />Have been working through the anthology, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Way-Wizard-ebook/dp/B004SI4BKA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054263&amp;sr=8-2">The Way of the Wizard</a>, which is fun for tube rides and has a few interesting stories. The ones by Martin, Gaiman, Silverberg and Le Guin stand out, which is probably what you&#8217;d expect.<br /><br />Jolie got me a bevy of books for my birthday. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peace-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765334569/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054559&amp;sr=8-2">Peace</a> by Gene Wolfe straight through almost instantly. It&#8217;s great. It made me read<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifth-Head-Cerberus-S-F-Masterworks/dp/0575094222/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054492&amp;sr=8-1"> Fifth Head of Cerberus</a> again. Fifth Head, by the way, is great. Really great. An ambiguous, intelligent, multi-layered, irresolvable meditation on identity, individuality and post-colonialism with strong Kafka and Proust notes. Read it.<br /><br />I&#8217;m clearly on a bit of a Wolfe bender at the moment. I just consulted my records and it looks like I also re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shadow-Torturer-ebook/dp/B005HRT9TE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054842&amp;sr=8-1">Shadow of the Torturer</a>. I picked up on a bunch of subtleties I missed last time.<br /><br />Turns out that I&#8217;m not a very visual reader. I don&#8217;t pick up details in descriptions and see them in my mind&#8217;s eye very well. If the same words get used, I&#8217;ll notice that. But a nebulous figure could be described as &#8220;fair-haired&#8221;, say, in one part of a book and then later as &#8220;blond&#8221;, and I might never actually guess that they were meant to be the same person. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m rubbish at guessing the murderer in most crime novels.<br /><br />Wolfe often uses visual clues like that. So when re-reading Fifth Head or Shadow, I have been compelled to read more slowly, more carefully, paying attention to what is actually going on in the narrated world. A wonderful, new experience.<br /><br />Also read a Rumpole omnibus. Jolly good fun, a bit repetitious, suspect the TV show would be better.<br /><br />And since writing this post a couple of weeks ago, quite a few more!</div>

I&#39;m similar, I&#39;m almost totally incapable of visualising things. It&#39;s the same with memory. When friends were memorising vocab they&#39;d come up with really visual memory hooks but that never worked for me. I was much faster looking at the word and remembering what it looked/sounded like.</div>
