When I started the year I had grand plans for my health and fitness. I don&#8217;t&nbsp;do New Years Resolutions, but the Christmas break is a great time to review my goals and to set new ones. Sadly, I&#8217;ve made barely any progress toward any of these goals, and in fact have regressed on some of them.<br /><br />If you don&#8217;t mind too much, I&#8217;d like to share the story with you. This isn&#8217;t so much by way of making excuses as getting things clear for me, and sorting out some kind of accountability.<br /><br />The first set-back was a&nbsp;wrist injury that happened pretty much as soon as I got back from Australia. It prevented me from kick-boxing for a couple of weeks and stopped me from starting any strength training. Perhaps for these reasons, I got fairly depressed in general, and started eating junk and drinking a little too much as a way of seeking comfort. Yuck.<br /><br />Once I got back from that I went straight into grading preparation mode for kick-boxing. Grading is physically exhausting, and demands heaps of energy, so I just shoved food into my mouth for four weeks, desperately trying to get enough calories. It&#8217;s also really stressful and time-consuming, so I didn&#8217;t start that strength training I wanted to.<br /><br />All this meant that I never got back on to my clean, pre-Christmas eating habits, nor my regular progress tracking. The latter is important, since it&#8217;s an early warning system and is very motivating.<br /><br />After the grading prep (and missing the actual grading day itself!), I dropped my kick-boxing training right back so as to help out more with wedding preparation and to find a place and move into the new flat where Joliette &amp; I live now. That was heaps of fun, but I didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to start new exercise habits, go back to tracking progress or clean up my eating. I think I went back on to drinking coffee at some point here.<br /><br />Moving house also got me stress eating again (way too much pizza), which kept up right on to the final stages of wedding preparation too. Although happily that last turned from stress eating into celebration eating as friends and family started to arrive.<br /><br />A couple of weeks before the wedding, I cracked a rib while sparring. That hurt a lot, and stopped me from doing any exercise. There&#8217;s not much you can do when it hurts to raise your arms over your head, or to twist your torso.<br /><br />And then on the honeymoon I spent a couple of blissful weeks doing nothing and eating everything.<br /><br />I really don&#8217;t want to make excuses. I didn&#8217;t choose to crack my rib or sprain my wrist, I could have chosen to respond to them better, and I certainly could have chosen to respond to the various stresses in my life in a different, healthier way.<br /><br />In the meantime, it&#8217;s been really inspiring to watch the progress of friends and colleagues (especially <a href="https://plus.google.com/118140811742423812280/posts">Sean</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/undacuvabrutha">Robbie</a>) who have been getting fitter.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve never really much liked the idea of sharing my progress before â€“ it just seems to personal a thing. But since their example helped me, maybe I&#8217;ll figure something out.<br /><br />What&#8217;s next then? Well, I&#8217;m already eating better, am back at kick-boxing and Jolie is being very supportive. I&#8217;m going to look over my goals again and see what I can salvage. I might even make a bet or try to find someone to compete against in order to get a bit of extra motivation.<br /><br /></div>

Yeah, pretty much. We still eat grains, but not as much and mostly just the less refined stuff - brown rice etc. It&#39;s pretty similar in respect to the no sugar thing I think. I bought a no-sugar cookbook which was basically paleo. It&#39;s pretty crazy how much stuff sugar is in though (sausages, stock powder, savoury biscuits, sauces &amp; condiments&#8230; the list goes on) so that&#39;s changed a lot of what we eat and how we cook.  Our Weber BBQ has been getting a lot more use lately! (even in winter). Soooo tasty. I&#39;ve also made a new friend who is Chinese and a great cook. There haven&#39;t been any 12 course banquets yet&#8230; but we&#39;ve had a lot of deliciousness sent our way! <br /><br />:)</div>

Hey Bron!<br /><br />Diet-wise, I actually try to eat paleo / primal, as recommended by<br />http://www.marksdailyapple.com/, http://www.nerdfitness.com/ and http://jasonferruggia.com/.  They all very much strongly discourage most sugar (allowing small amounts of berries and the occasional sweet potato).<br /><br />One of the great consequences is that I go out of my way to eat more vegetables.<br /><br />Is what you&#39;re doing with the sugar-free thing?<br /><br />In any case, I&#39;m back to eating that way (modulo the occasional 12 course Chinese banquet), and I feel great.</div>

Congratulations! :) It was lovely to see the happy photos of you both on the special day.<br /><br />I felt bad about jumping in and adding more advice, so I&#39;ve waited a few weeks before writing this. But I still reckon it&#39;s relevant&#8230; and, you know, I can&#39;t help myself if I think I can be helpful! But firstly, let me just say how enjoyable it was to read your very well written post.<br /><br />So, I wanted to recommend a book that&#39;s completely changed the way we eat (since Feb). It&#39;s called Sweet Poison, by David Gillespie (actually I read his second book the Sweet Poison Quit Plan which summarizes the science simply and is more practical).<br /><br />The elevator pitch is this: sugar (fructose/sucrose) is addictive, it&#39;s in everything (not just sweet stuff) and it affects our natural appetite control. Withdraw from sugar and suddenly eating healthy is easy, stress, mood and sleep may improve and almost everyone whose done it has lost weight without even trying.<br /><br />Most of my friends think I&#39;m nuts (except 2 who have tried it and love it). But since Feb this has become the new normal for us and both Nick and I reckon we&#39;ll never go back.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck with the training. Let me know if you do want any more info. And again, congratulations to you both.</div>

This is very much a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; recommendation, but, I think your main priority should be to manage the stress.<br /><br />Willpower is an exhaustible resource, and this chronology of failure sounds like you just ran out at some point (between broken bones and wedding preparations it&#39;s no wonder).  Stress erodes the will, so, rather than attempting to compensate with more willpower, try to manage the stress at its source (which is to say, your mind, not the environment that produces stress).<br /><br />A lot of folks recommend mindfulness meditation.  That didn&#39;t seem to work too well for me, as I haven&#39;t gotten myself together to actually do it regularly, but then, I don&#39;t have the wherewithal to drag myself to kickboxing practice either, so perhaps you&#39;ll have better luck with that.</div>

I have to agree with you about it being a personal thing. I started focusing on weight loss back in March, and it has actually been going very well (strong on 1kg/week consistently). I haven&#39;t really shared it, though I can see the point of it being encouraging to others.<br /><br />I have to say recording what I eat was really what made it happen for me. That and premade salads that make it as easy for me to have a salad rather than a sandwich for lunch.</div>
