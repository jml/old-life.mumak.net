<a href="http://xnreflections.blogspot.com/">Mikey</a> <a href="http://xnreflections.blogspot.com/2008/09/getting-stuff-achieved-sin-bin.html">threw down the gauntlet</a> to his fellow David Allen devotees.

I <a href="http://xnreflections.blogspot.com/2008/09/getting-stuff-achieved-sin-bin.html?showComment=1221181800000#c8533174751236494244">replied to his post</a>, but thought my reply was chunky enough to re-post here.<br /><br />The time has come for me to confess although GTD has strongly influenced the way I&#8217;ve thought, I&#8217;ve really fallen off the rails with it.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to pick up the precise point of failure, but here are some thoughts.<br /><ul><li>I&#8217;ve switched implementations a few times (Emacs, GTiddlyWiki, Remember the Milk, Tomboy, iCal), and there&#8217;s none that I really, really like.</li><li>Most of my tasks are tracked in <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/launchpad-bazaar/+bugs?search=Search&amp;field.assignee=jml">Launchpad</a>. Copying them to a separate system seems wrong.</li><li>Many, many, many ideas I&#8217;ve had have been pushed back because someone else sets my priorities. I don&#8217;t really know how to best track theseâ€”someday/maybes perhaps.</li><li>My set of contexts has shrunk drastically. I&#8217;m basically always at home, on my laptop with an internet connection and phone line able to do work stuff. Breaking stuff up into @home, @work, @online, @computer, @phone doesn&#8217;t make any sense for me.</li><li>I don&#8217;t really feel support from my manager for maintaining the system, even though people appreciate my work &#8220;gardening the bug tracker&#8221;. This makes me reluctant to spend Friday arvo or Monday morning doing a weekly review. This might be imagined.<br /></li><li>Things have been broken so long that I feel I need to have a two day reboot. Scheduling such a thing is hard.</li><li>My collection habit has broken off. This is partly due to having crappy tools: the spiral notebooks irritate me, my pens keep disappearing and I can&#8217;t always carry my moleskine around.</li><li>I&#8217;m not in regular conversation with others who strive for a mind like water. Even the people I&#8217;ve spoken to who understand the system don&#8217;t really seem to value it.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>I get about 150 new email conversations in my inbox every day, and then probably get another 50-60 during the day, excluding spam. Most of these emails are <span style="font-style: italic;">totally irrelevant</span> to me and my life, so I get into this groove of &#8220;Crap; Crap; Crap; Crap; Ooh, interesting; Crap; Crap; Crap etc&#8221; without doing any further processing. It takes ages to get back to actually reviewing the interesting emails and figuring out what I need to do. Then it takes more time to actual do it.<br /></li></ul>I miss the feeling of cleanliness and freedom that I had when I was doing GTD well. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if there are real gaps in the system that I&#8217;ll be able to understand better once I get back into it.<br /><br />In any case, I&#8217;d love to know your thoughts.</div>

Separate desktops would be a pain, and yes, the web 2.0 apps are all terrible in different ways and difficult to evaluate.<BR/><BR/>I think the real benefit of GTD is the way it provides a pattern language for organization: your calendar is not your todo list is not your list of projects etc.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ll be keen to hear how your wiki system evolves.</div>

I only tried GTD for about a week, my major problem was being a user of two separate desktops, necessitating an online or fully synchronised system, and total impatience with signing up for 100 million Web 2.0 sites in order to find a compatible one. (Seriously folks, if I need to do much more than provide my OpenID, at least for an extensive trial, I will not use your web site.) Tomboy didn&#8217;t cut it.<BR/><BR/>But frankly, I&#8217;m so far behind in this headspace. I never even got to the point of being organised with my university lecture notes. I am pretty sure that I did not re-read my notes for any course, ever. I suck at doing this for academic reading too, mostly because&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I understand writings in a cloud-lie, not sequentially. (This is the reason I have this apparently inexplicable habit of reading almost all books not entirely in page order.) I can do calendars. I can do email. I can usually manage my tasklist in my head even if it does cost in cycles and mood. It&#8217;s proving problematic with my PhD, for which I am moving to a wiki and hoping I can evolve a system of some variety.</div>

For implementing GTD you might try out this web-based application:<BR/><BR/>http://www.Gtdagenda.com<BR/><BR/>You can use it to manage your goals, projects and tasks, set next actions and contexts, use checklists, schedules and a calendar.<BR/>A mobile version and iCal are available too.<BR/><BR/>Hope you like it.</div>
