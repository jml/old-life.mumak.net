If you are ever in Hobart on a Monday evening, it&#8217;s worth dropping into Onba (just opposite the Republic) for their Open Mic Night.<br /><br />Onba opened up some time after I left Hobart. It&#8217;s a smallish place that does tapas, cocktails, wine, beer, live music, up-market cafe meals, free(ish) Internet access and decent coffee. The atmosphere is great and the whisky selection is small yet tasteful. Your average Sydney pub has nothing on this.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect at the open mic session. I mean, I figured things would be pretty laid-back and friendly, but I wasn&#8217;t sure about what kind of music they&#8217;d have, or how good it would be. First thing I see when I went up the stairs was my friend Alistair playing guitar accompanying two people on bongos and a chap on one of those hand-held things with keyboards that you blow into. I recognized one of the bongo players, since I had glared at him murderously the day before when he dared to play during my 2pm breakfast.<br /><br />It was a bit more world / folk than I&#8217;m used to, but it was good for all that. After Al stepped down, the guy on the melodica (yay learning) swapped places with the non-breakfast bongo player and did some improv. That was fun.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of the evening (except, perhaps, for the fact that Talisker costs $26 a glass) was hearing Al sing some of his own songs. I&#8217;d heard some of his stuff a few years back at the turn of the century and it was all well-polished and what-have-you, but since then&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his music and how much it affected me. I could pull it all apart and say how his singing is much better and how he&#8217;s obviously more relaxed and that live acoustic in a nice pub is more appropriate to the songs than a professionally mixed recording in an office—I could do that—but I&#8217;ll leave that to the professionals.<br /><br />Also, you&#8217;ve probably forgotten how good Prince is (was). This is OK, he&#8217;s been dormant for a while and his recent stuff isn&#8217;t great. Still, you should take yourself down to your record store and find something that has <span style="font-style: italic;">Raspberry Beret</span> on it. One guy at Onba played a warm acoustic cover, good enough to make me shut up and listen.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">the kind u find</span></div>

Nah, this guy doesn&#8217;t actually look like him, he just does a cool cover.</div>

Have you seen the guy that looks like Prince at Coles Sandy Bay? Maybe it was him doing the warm acoustic cover&#8230;</div>
