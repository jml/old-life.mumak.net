I can imagine a librarian; call him Norris. Norris is sitting on a verandah, drinking an iced tea that&#8217;s just started to sweat in the weekend sun. He&#8217;s reading a book that re-interprets the reign of King Richard III in the light of a vampiric illness, but his eyes just move over the same few lines.<br /><br />Norris is really thinking about how he can make his library a more pleasant place to be, somewhere people like to hang out. Perhaps a potplant or two? Maybe some artwork from local residents? We could even arrange some sort of special with the café downstairs. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.<br /><br />Your problem, dear Norris, is that your library is built to house books. Everything about it is there to keep them organized, contained and available. It&#8217;s a warehouse—nothing more. Adding a pot-plant will make it a warehouse with a pot-plant. In this way, books are worse than boxes. Books have a force of their own. Too many together in one space can become oppressive. Being in such a place is like standing at the edge of a great cliff, or sharing a cage with a tiger: awe-inspiring, exhilarating, terrifying; never comfortable. Face it Norris, it&#8217;s too late for you and your library.<br /><br />In another place, a place where the ducks rule and the traffic lights whistle, in a university town without a university, in a village where the square at night is home to racer boys and a fluorescent cross of many colours, there is a Library.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to say what makes this Library different. Other libraries feel like temples, or crypts; this one feels like a big lounge room. There&#8217;s not the buzz of an urban café, but there&#8217;s not the usual solemn quiet either. From the main floor you can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the CD and film area downstairs. Around the corner from the non-fiction area there&#8217;s a public phone. The walls have reds and blues and yellows. On the north side there reading chairs next to large windows that look onto the town square and the town&#8217;s duck lords.  While I was there a boy played the piano part of Bohemian Rhapsody from memory. Anyone could easily spend a whole day here and reckon it pleasant one.<br /><br />Obviously it was intended to be this way from the beginning. The comfort of the Library is partly because it is whole, not a few token efforts scraped together. The planners must have asked themselves &#8220;How can we make this a pleasant place to be&#8221; over and over. They had a core value by which all decisions could be measured. They have sacrificed some virtues—there are many fewer books than the space permits—in order to excel in this hospitality.<br /><br />Perhaps poor Norris can take comfort in this. His library may never quite be the <span style="font-style: italic;">place </span>that Palmerston North Library is, but it can certainly have <span style="font-style: italic;">more books</span>. After all, what&#8217;s a library for?</div>

Awesome.<BR/><BR/>Have you ever tried the Customs House Library? It&#8217;s at circular quay, but don&#8217;t hold that against it.<BR/><BR/>A girl whose blog I read often goes there for &#8216;writing days&#8217;. Here&#8217;s a post about how cool it is:<BR/><BR/>http://hippocampusextensions.com/karen/archives/2008/04/<BR/><BR/>(scroll down quite a bit, it&#8217;s the 4th or 5th one down the page - I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to save it by itself)</div>
