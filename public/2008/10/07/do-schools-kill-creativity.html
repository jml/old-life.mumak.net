Even if you don&#8217;t care, <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">this talk by Sir Ken Robinson</a> is funny, raises some good points and is only about fifteen minutes long.</div>

I liked it too. I&#8217;ve been having concerns about our education systems for a while and this contributed a few more pages in a mental book of critique.</div>

A fantastic talk that raises so many things for me. Let me offload (I actually wrote &#8220;overload&#8221; first!?):<BR/><BR/>- In countries where creativity *is* valued (eg dance in Latin America) the education system is dry and involves rote learning only (not that this isn&#8217;t a form of intelligence). So a culture that values creativity in general doesn&#8217;t necessary value it in education. <BR/><BR/>- I feel really strongly about this sort of thing. I think of very talented people who don&#8217;t realise they&#8217;re talented and who might even think they&#8217;re dumb or a failure. Everyone - including people with disabilities - has something to offer and something that will bring them pleasure. <BR/><BR/>- What has helped me realise my talents and creativity is: being told of my talents; being given free reign (to do things my way or to decide what I will do full stop); being encouraged; being understood and supported through the glitches; being given wise suggestions/guidance. This was done (as you know) in the context of a church apprenticeship. <BR/><BR/>- I think the Christian idea of different people having different gifts, each person occupying a different, valuable part in the body has a lot to offer. <BR/><BR/>- Maybe the trickest thing educationally is that the teacher won&#8217;t share all the students&#8217; gifts and it&#8217;s difficult to teach people stuff *you* don&#8217;t Know. But maybe that&#8217;s where the model I experienced in my apprenticeship comes in. <BR/>How does all this fit with what you (used to?) think about how schools should just be to teach reading and writing and other things are for the other things? <BR/><BR/>Fi</div>

That was great! He does raise some good points and he even mentions one of my dad&#8217;s favourite sermon illustrations.</div>
