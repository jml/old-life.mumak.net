<b>Programming</b><br /><br />I learnt this while I was at school, but I (mostly) didn&#8217;t learn it in school. Programming is such a joy to me, and has given me tools that I&#8217;ve been able to apply to all sorts of things.<br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to learn, you might want to try <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/">Think Python</a> or (my favourite) <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a>.<br /><br /><b>Organization</b><br /><br />David Allen makes this point in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_19?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=getting%20things%20done&amp;sprefix=getting%20things%20done%2Caps%2C188&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Agetting%20things%20done">Getting Things Done</a>. Much of life would be easier if everyone were in the habit of actually collecting all of the inputs in their life, asking &#8220;what&#8217;s the next action?&#8221;, and began planning by focusing on the outcome.<br /><br /><b>Yoga</b><br /><br />Since taking up kickboxing, my flexibility has improved a lot, but I&#8217;m nowhere near as flexible as I would have been if I had been in a habit of stretching since my youth.<br /><br />My kickboxing school also has a yoga class that I&#8217;ve been to a couple of times. I&#8217;ve never done anything else that requires that combination of strength, flexibility, and self-control, and that leaves me feeling so good afterwards. I wish it were part of the regular discipline of my life.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re in London, I can highly recommend KB Fitness&#8217;s yoga class.<br /><br /><b>Latin</b><br /><br />I know, I&#8217;m a snob. I do wish I was conversant in a non-English language, and Latin seems a fine choice. While it wouldn&#8217;t help me be a better trading partner, or actually speak to anyone, it would make me better connected with my civilization&#8217;s history: the actual Roman bit; the dark Churchy bubonic bit; and the Enlightened, wigged, Whiggish bit when they cared about the Churchy bit and the Roman bit.<br /><br />One day, I&#8217;ll finish working through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lingua-Latina-Illustrata-Pars-Familia/dp/1585104205">Lingua Latina per se Illustrata</a>&nbsp;and actually manage to read some Ovid.<br /><br />Failing that, they could have taught us.<br /><br /><b>Chinese</b><br /><b><br /></b>It&#8217;s not just that Chinese is a different language that lots of people speak that&#8217;s quite difficult to become literate in – although really that should be enough – it&#8217;s also that China has a long and rich history that&#8217;s very different from Western history and if we were better able to compare and contrast the two, surely we would understand ourselves and our present much better.<br /><br /><b>Data analysis</b><br /><br />Turns out that aligning your opinions with reality makes you more effective. News at 11.<br /><br /><b>Personal finance</b><br /><br />Maybe they did try to teach us this at school and I never bothered. Even so, finally getting a grip on this in my late twenties after over a decade of working for a living seems a little slow.<br /><br />The things that have helped me most with this have been a seminar that my church ran once, and the book <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/book/">I Will Teach You To Be Rich</a>&nbsp;(NB: I greatly dislike his website).<br /><br /><b>Logic (dressed for battle)</b><br /><b><br /></b>We learnt maths and we did proofs, but I don&#8217;t remember ever being asked to evaluate something someone said and point out the bits where it was illogical. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember any teacher ever saying that there was a difference between pointing out that an argument was flawed and claiming that a conclusion was incorrect. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember being taught tricks like taking every time a politician said &#8220;Australia&#8221; and replacing it with &#8220;Stalinist Russia&#8221; to see if they were actually making sense.<br /><br /><b>Drawing</b><br /><b><br /></b>We had a few classes, but there weren&#8217;t enough hours to get me to be able to draw. I don&#8217;t want to be a good drawer of things, but I do want to be able to put pencil to paper and depict (even poorly) what I see, rather than first interpreting it to symbols and drawing pictures of the symbols. That seems a handy mental discipline.<br /><br />What do you wish we were all taught in school?<br /><br /></div>

Rhetoric.<br /><br />It&#39;s not quite the same as logic, I think, though it&#39;s related.  Much of the modern world consists of people trying to sell you something against your own interests and often against the collective interests of most well-meaning people &#8211; most noticeably, politicians and corporations often must do this, by their nature.  The problem is not merely that they often say illogical things, it&#39;s that they also use tricks of argument specifically designed to subvert whatever defenses one already has in place against mere illogic.<br /><br />My understanding is that classical rhetoric was not taught in order to train a political class in persuasion so much as to immunize the highest ranks of the constituent class against victimization: you learned the dirty tricks of argument (each with its own Latin name) not to use them yourself, but in order to recognize when someone else was using them on you.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to know when precisely this was dropped from the curriculum, and why :-).</div>

Right choice of Latin book.<br /><br />Ovid is not really that difficult. Selections of Metamorphoses are usually adapted as some of the first stuff students read.</div>

I think personal finance, or business skills generally, are trapped on the other side of the artificial academic/vocational divide. You&#39;ll need business skills or higher maths, but never both! I doubt that divide was ever especially useful, but it certainly isn&#39;t now. When I think of the best performing 20 or so people I went to high school or undergrad with, the number of them who are in academia now is quite small (2, I think) and the number who have use for business skills is, well, everyone else.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think religious education should be imposed outside religious schools, but given that I was at a Catholic school, I think I would have benefited from both Catholic theology, and a more religion-centered view of Australian history and politics. It&#39;s got modern uses even: Tony Abbott regards himself as the DLP&#39;s and B.A. Santamaria&#39;s political heir. How one could go through a Catholic school in Australia in the 1990s and not hear Santamaria&#39;s name I do not know, but I did.<br /><br />I wish physical education had been centered more on the very fundamentals: what fitness is, how one acquires and maintains it, modifications of exercise regimes for the bottom 10% in agility, etc.<br /><br />Ethics generally. I remember in Year 8 one of the teachers questioned us over our shamelessness about, eg, lying about having done homework (well, I say &quot;our&quot;, I just did the homework, but I knew what he was talking about) in that when caught, we said things like &quot;well, it was worth a try&quot; and did not appear ashamed of lying and cheating. He recalled such things being shameful in his school days. I doubt there would have been any revolution in this if we&#39;d had some instruction in ethics, but maybe students would have intellectually understood his side of the divide on that. Plus it&#39;s an ideal life stage to begin to consider the philosophy of law, specifically, by what right does anyone have authority over anyone else?</div>

1. Arabic. I grew up (and now live again) in a country where Arabic is the 2nd most spoken language, surrounded by many countries where Arabic is the only language spoken. Not teaching us Arabic was stupid and cruel, especially if you consider that languages are quite easy to acquire until the age of twelve or so.<br /><br />2. How to be successful. As pupils we were expected to be successful at some things (like essays and exams) but no-one ever taught us how to be successful - it was assumed that we should simply do &quot;our best&quot;. It&#39;s only as grown-up that I found (by trial and error and self-education) that there are general rules one can follow for being successful at the things you do and when I did I felt a bit cheated because of all the time I wasted leaving success to luck.<br /><br />3. Science. Not the clumsy lab experiments we had in science class but rather how science actually works. It took me quite a few years after leaving school before I had a chance to catch up on even the most basic material and I suspect that most of the people I went to school with never did.<br /><br /></div>

Last year, I read a heap of books. Way too many, probably. One big chunk of this reading was what I like to call a &#8220;rationality binge&#8221;. Spurred by the excellent <i><a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a></i>&nbsp;and by <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Crooked-Thinking-Yourself-ebook/dp/B004YD1S1E/ref=tmm_kin_title_0">Straight and Crooked Thinking</a></i>, I&#8217;ve long wanted to get a better grip on rational discourse.<br /><br />This has been amplified by other books I&#8217;ve read that dare to suggest that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Facts-Dangerous-Half-Truths-Total-Nonsense/dp/1591398622/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1361362024&amp;sr=8-1">decisions in companies should be based on evidence</a>, and that you should&nbsp;<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">treat your crazy idea for a new product like a hypothesis that needs falsifying</a>.<br /><br />So I guess it&#8217;s not right to say I want a better grip on rational discourse. What I actually want is to help myself and my friends stop wasting their time on things that sound plausible but are actually utter tosh.<br /><br />Amongst our weapons are <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">clarity</a>, <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">logic</a>, <a href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Clear_Thinking/Informal_Fallacies/Tricks/tricks.html">rhetoric</a>, and an almost fanatical devotion to actual data.<br /><br />&#8220;Data&#8221; isn&#8217;t in the classical trivium, but is just as essential as the other three and just as tricky. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow-ebook/dp/B005MJFA2W/">Humans are really bad at thinking statistically</a>&nbsp;and there is <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">more</a> <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">data</a> <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/index.html">out</a> <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/directory">there</a> <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">than</a> ever before.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been trying to work my way through <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats/"><i>Think Stats</i></a>, which came recommended by friends, but I got bogged down trying to work through it in a weird programming language rather than just sticking with the one in the book. Even today, I&#8217;m ashamed that I don&#8217;t really understand&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes&#8217; theorem</a>&nbsp;or its consequences, and embarrassed that Nate Silver&#8217;s work in the recent U.S. election might as well be magic to me.<br /><br />Still, I&#8217;ve been plugging away at it. I now know the difference between a cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study. I kind of, sort of know what statistical significance is, even though I don&#8217;t really have the tools to figure it out. I&#8217;ve been able to read papers on the <a href="http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/2010-12%20ExPUnexpectedSIGKDD.pdf">perils of relying on the results of web experiments</a> and actually follow them.<br /><br />I haven&#8217;t yet had much of a chance to apply these things professionally, but my plan is to skill up (i.e. finish reading through <i>Think Stats</i>), and then apply statistical reasoning to my next couple of personal projects.<br /><br />At the bare bones level of actually <i>gathering </i>data and tracking how it changes, it&#8217;s not too much of an exaggeration to say that it has been life changing.<br /><br />As boring as it sounds, a bunch of numbers in a couple of spreadsheets have been my greatest allies in my constant quest to not be a debt-enslaved fat ass.<br /><br />Left to my natural impulses, I will buy whatever feels good at the time, eat whatever you put in front of me, and then head out later to buy more food to eat. This isn&#8217;t exactly sustainable behaviour. So, for the last little while I&#8217;ve been tracking my spending and recording my weight and such. For my fitness goals I&#8217;ve got fairly detailed records that go back over three years.<br /><br />As proof:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMrje3l0RZs/USTCd1JGyvI/AAAAAAAADXI/oQJ32yXzqts/s1600/Rplot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vMrje3l0RZs/USTCd1JGyvI/AAAAAAAADXI/oQJ32yXzqts/s320/Rplot1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Which tells the story that I lost a lot of weight in 2011, have kept most of it off while mostly not caring about weight loss, and have recently started to care again, with okayish results.<br /><br />Because I have to explicitly do work to take the measurements and record them, I only do so when I care, and more often when I&#8217;m feeling good about myself physically. And when I track myself more closely, I tend to be more disciplined about how I eat. &nbsp;Or at least, that&#8217;s what I think. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d go about inferring it from the data.<br /><br />One great thing about having this data for so long a period is that I can set reasonable expectations what progress I&#8217;ll make over the next few months. This gets me excited – I like working toward concrete goals – and will hopefully spare me disappointment. Best of both worlds.<br /><br />I realize that all of this is a bit nerdy, but I can&#8217;t help but think it&#8217;s of fundamental importance. Not me losing weight – that&#8217;s just vanity dressed up as good sense – but measuring things that matter to us, and using that data and our reason to make decisions can only improve the world. <br /><br />But if I, as a dedicated geek with a maths degree, can&#8217;t be bothered working through a basic stats intro book, how can I expect others to do so?<br /><br />Perhaps it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m afraid that as the tools get better and more data becomes available, a gap will grow between those who are making reality-based decisions and those who are having their decisions made for them.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: exercise.</div>

<i>Late, and I&#8217;m not at all happy with the result.</i>&nbsp;<i>However, <a href="https://twitter.com/metagnome/status/303298910263316480">Bice has called me on it</a>, so here it is.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><br /></i><br />When Richard awoke, he was not in his bedroom, which was the customary place for him to rise. Nor was he in any bedroom that he recognized, although if you quizzed him on it, you would learn that there weren&#8217;t that many that he could. Indeed was he not in any bedroom at all.<br /><br />Instead, he was in a sitting room, lying flat on the floor and staring at an ornate ceiling that appeared to be moving. &nbsp;This was not what he expected. The last thing he remembered was playing a friendly game of cards in the home of a well-to-do clergyman, or someone of that ilk.<br /><br />He peeled himself off the carpet, woozed lurchingly to his feet and looked around. &nbsp;The room was furnished in the older style, with an ornamental ceiling, too many chairs, and all of it in angry mustards and burgundies and pink pinstripes. &nbsp;It was enough to give one a headache.<br /><br />There weren&#8217;t any windows to the room, which struck Richard as odd. &nbsp;There was a door though. &nbsp;It was a simple affair compared to the garish colours and &nbsp;patterns of the rest of the room. &nbsp;The handle had a curve chosen to match the crest of the chaise longue and the swooping legs of the chairs and tea tables that seemed to be everywhere in the room.<br /><br />And yet, whatever symmetry intended by the deranged mind behind the decor for the room was marred by the bulbous and ungainly body slumbering unquietly in the opposite corner.<br /><br />Richard quickly tried the handle. &nbsp;His memories of last night were only slowly returning to his fogged mind, but the snoring hillock of flesh in the corner was hard to forget. &nbsp;The door was locked, naturally. &nbsp;Some deep, reptilian reaction made him shake frantically at the handle, only to stop immediately as the more rational fear of waking the beast began to take hold.<br /><br />If only we were sooner gripped by our better doubts! &nbsp;The gelatinous mountain stirred, rising on its hind-quarters and emitting a bellow that rattled Richard&#8217;s teeth.<br /><br />&#8220;Jacob, what a delight to see you&#8221;, said Richard, demonstrating that he was not incapable of deceit.<br /><br />&#8220;Richard? Yes. Good. What time is it? Where&#8217;s Smith? Right.&#8221; Even at the best of times, Jacob tended to spare his interlocutor the difficulty of replying to his enquiries, and it appeared that immediately after rising was far from that. &nbsp;Richard tensed his legs, ready to run even though there was nowhere to run to. &nbsp;Any minute now, Jacob would remember.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh?&#8221;, said Richard, as some answer seemed to be expected.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money&#8221;, Jacob repeated, wagging his finger &#8211; which happened to be nearly the same size, shape and colour as an uncooked Cumberland sausage &#8211; at Richard. &nbsp;As he said this, he stepped forward and knocked over one of the ridiculous chairs, its leg snapping under his heel.<br /><br />Richard edged back slowly toward the door. &nbsp;If one were given to a sort of narrow-minded, technical, hopelessly out-dated, moralistic way of putting things then, yes, one could say he had taken Jacob&#8217;s money. &nbsp;Richard himself preferred to think that anyone who sat down to an obviously fixed game of cards instead gave him money. &nbsp;It implied a generosity of spirit that did Jacob credit.<br /><br />Still, occasionally one must sacrifice nobility of sentiment on the altar of rude circumstance. &nbsp;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <i>take</i> your money&#8221;, Richard lied, &#8220;I was merely looking after it for you.&#8221; &nbsp;He wouldn&#8217;t fall for that, but perhaps it would delay the beating for long enough for someone to open this blasted door and rescue him.<br /><br />&#8220;Is that so? &nbsp;Well, return it to me now and I might even thank you for it.&#8221; Richard didn&#8217;t believe him, but reached for the winnings anyway. &nbsp;Desperate times and all that.<br /><br />It wasn&#8217;t there. &nbsp;Richard stumbled sideways over a too dainty table, fell over and quivered back up again. &nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have it on me&#8221;. &nbsp;But where the hell was it? &nbsp;&#8220;Carrying that much lucre on my person would be both demeaning and foolhardy&#8221;. &nbsp;After the game, his partner Smith had left, leaving him with the two they had just rinsed. &nbsp;Why had he done that? &nbsp;Jacob&#8217;s hands were perilously close to his throat. &nbsp;&#8220;I was afraid that we would both fall to drink and so hid the money elsewhere, to protect it from our worser selves.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money, and you lost it&#8221;. &nbsp;Normally Richard would prize such clarity of thought.<br /><br />&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t lose it. &nbsp;Someone must have stolen it. &nbsp;Why else would we be imprisoned here?&#8221;<br /><br />Jacob looked confused, as if their situation had only just occurred to him. He went to the door to open it. &nbsp;The handle was tiny in his hands, but despite his turning, shaking, and pulling, the door remained firmly shut. &nbsp;He banged on the door, shouted and waited, yet no one answered.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money, lost it, and trapped us both.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, we are both trapped together, although I do not know how it came to be, or even where we are.&#8221;<br /><br />Even as he spoke, a key rattle in the lock. &nbsp;Richard spun around, and James orbited on his axis. &nbsp;The door began to open.<br /><div style="font-style: italic;"><br /></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><br /></div></div>

I really like this, actually, although I can easily imagine how frustrating a piece it was to write.<br /><br />&quot;Richard himself preferred to think that anyone who sat down to an obviously fixed game of cards instead gave him money.  It implied a generosity of spirit that did Jacob credit.&quot; ← very nice.</div>

<br />I&#8217;m going to be brutally honest. &nbsp;It&#8217;s 9pm on a Sunday, I&#8217;ve just come in from the cold and the rain, I&#8217;m exhausted from four nights on the trot with little sleep and I&#8217;m in the middle of a good book. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to be sitting here and writing, but I&#8217;m doing it anyway. &nbsp;As much as I want to curl up with a Baileys and some Brahms, I can&#8217;t bring myself to let this deadline pass without some effort to meet it. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to admit defeat.<br /><br />It&#8217;s tempting to add &#8220;not to Bice&#8221; to that, but it would only be for dramatic effect. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve played countless games of many kinds against Bice and have almost certainly lost the majority of them. &nbsp;If there were any shame in losing to him, it&#8217;s a shame to which I&#8217;ve become well accustomed.<br /><br />Setting aside our many rounds of Soul Calibur 2, where I feel that the vast disparity of scores exaggerates the true difference in skill, the games we&#8217;ve mostly competed in have been board games. &nbsp;Long, strategic board games with many players like <i>Civilisation</i>, <i>Risk</i>, or <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Thrones-Board-2nd-Edition/dp/1589947207/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360533882&amp;sr=8-1">Game of Thrones</a></i>.<br /><br />The way it works is like this. &nbsp;Bice, Chris, myself and at least one person named James will gather around a table and set it up. &nbsp;The person named James is sometimes my brother, sometimes my friend James Whelan. &nbsp;The role of the James is to act as my nemesis. &nbsp;If there is more than one James present, then the only difficulty is figuring out what the plural of &#8216;nemesis&#8217; is. &nbsp;Also &#8216;James&#8217;.<br /><br />Before the game, the James will warn the other players against my notorious abilities and to urge them to unite against me. &nbsp;During the opening, they will seize upon my economy of motion and speed of decision making as examples that – unless I&#8217;m stopped by extraordinary means – my victory is certain.<br /><br />Then the game will progress to the middle phase, where at least one James will hurl everything he&#8217;s got at me, sabotaging whatever manoeuvres I had planned and leaving both of our forces greatly diminished and my spirit crushed by the irrationality and the sheer unfairness of it all.<br /><br />Broken now in mind, robbed of strength, and probably never actually being that good in the first place my game quickly crumbles and I&#8217;m soon eliminated. Whichever James attacked me is wiped out shortly after that.<br /><br />Then Chris wins.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m bitter, it&#8217;s not that I mind losing to Chris, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m just convinced that if only I could throw off the shackles of my Jacobion Nemesi (or Nemetical Jameses) I could lose on my own terms in more interesting ways. &nbsp;I enjoy their company (and indeed, &nbsp;competing against them) too much to ever try to exclude them from playing, but I do sometimes hope that maybe this will be the game where Reason rules and I don&#8217;t get ganged up on in the early phases. (OK, I <i>am</i> bitter, but I really don&#8217;t mind losing to Chris)<br /><br />Phew. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been wanting to get that off my chest for a long time. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word is &#8220;door&#8221;.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

Losing to Chris at boardgames is a universal experience, part of the human condition.</div>

<br /><b>Disclaimer:</b> I realize that by any sane judgment, my life is so amazingly free of problems that I might as well be cavorting about in the strawberry patches of Elysium, singing counterpoint with the Butterflies of Jubilation that accompany me always. &nbsp;My own knowledge of real trouble, real suffering is so slight that I ought to remain silent on the subject. &nbsp;Yet I hope I have something to say about the more shallow difficulties that we all face.<br /><br /><br />As the philosopher said, shit happens. &nbsp;This life inevitably has difficulty, danger, and disaster, and when these things happen, they don&#8217;t feel like part of the grand tragi-comic symphony of humanity, they just plain suck.<br /><br />However, if I get to choose how my problems come to me, and I&#8217;m choosing based on my<br />own selfish comfort, then deal them to me as one crisis after another.<br /><br />A crisis is obvious, and that&#8217;s always a good start. &nbsp;We can look at it, and go, &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s a crisis all right. &nbsp;Better get onto it.&#8221; &nbsp;The alternative is slow, seeping, dripping problems that we don&#8217;t notice until it&#8217;s too late, or worse yet, static ever-present problems that we are only half-conscious of and become a kind of background music of suck, like a television that&#8217;s on in another room that we can&#8217;t be bothered to turn off.<br /><br />An example is being overweight. &nbsp;For most of my life, I&#8217;ve been carrying around an unhealthy amount of body fat, and I&#8217;ve always been unhappy about it. (I told you my problems were shallow). As <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/bespoke.html">I mentioned last week</a>, when I moved to the UK I started putting on even more weight. &nbsp;Eventually, I took a couple of weeks off work with the express intent of using the second week to kick off a habit of eating more healthily and doing some exercise. &nbsp;In a sense, I had to force a crisis, and even then it took me years to do so.<br /><br />On the other hand, if I had at some point in my past been thin and then woken up one day with an extra forty kilos of flab, I&#8217;m fairly certain I would have take action that same day.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also a buzz that you get from tackling a crisis. &nbsp;The stakes are high, the clock is running, and every action is weighed with significance. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just that we feel like important people doing important things – although it is at least that – but also that our attention is completely engrossed. &nbsp;When a calamity descends upon us while we are in the middle of another, our first reaction is how unfair it is. &nbsp;Perhaps that&#8217;s partly because we resent the<br />disruption of that perfect, rapt attention? &nbsp;If we handle the crisis well, then there&#8217;s also a feeling of mastery. &nbsp;We were hit with the worst, but we gave it our best and we came out on top.<br /><br />Even emotional crises have a perverse buzz: it&#8217;s not for nothing that we speak of &#8220;wallowing&#8221; in self pity. &nbsp;And even if we avoid that, there&#8217;s something welcome about the way such a crisis can simplify things. &nbsp;People often say &#8220;it makes you realize what&#8217;s really important&#8221;.<br /><br />And not only does the crisis make us feel significant and competent, but often it makes others (for a happy moment!) look on us the same way. &nbsp;Someone who averts disaster in the nick of time is a hero, someone who takes a broken, ruined situation and turns it around is a saviour. &nbsp;If we handle a crisis well, we are commended by others – often even if it was a result of our negligence!<br /><br />So for the status, for the mental clarity, for the rush, and because it&#8217;s much easier than trying to identify and correct any other kind of problem, give me a crisis any day.<br /><br />But please, one at a time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div><b>The Alphabet Supremacy</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>This post would not have happened without the artificially induced crisis brought about by the&nbsp;<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>&nbsp;project that I&#8217;m doing with&nbsp;<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.

It&#39;s also worth mentioning where a few of these ideas came from:<br /><br />On attention, <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Confessions</i> by St Augustine, <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allen.<br /><br />On mastery, <i>Drive</i> by Dan Pink (I&#39;ve only watched the animation), <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Creating Passionate Users</i> by Kathy Sierra.<br /><br />On the feeling of significance and the dangers therein, talking to any decent sysadmin.<br /></div>

<br />It was the spring of 2009, and I&#8217;d just moved to London. &nbsp;Which made it the autumn of 2009. &nbsp;I had got a promotion at work. &nbsp;No longer an engineer on Launchpad, I was now its Product Strategist, and thus was moving to the UK.<br /><br />Moving to London was a big change. &nbsp;If you are like me, then any big move triggers questions about what other things you could change, apart from your location. &nbsp;Perhaps I&#8217;ll join a gym when I get there, or maybe try to cook more – things like that.<br /><br />One change that I thought about a lot was dressing better. &nbsp;Or at least, looking back it seems that way. &nbsp;What actually happened was I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbentley/4291810841/">grew my hair long and gained five or ten kilos</a>. &nbsp;In my memory, though, I distinctly recall thinking about smartening up my look. &nbsp;What can you do?<br /><br />In particular, I wanted to start wearing suits – good suits. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d look great in a good suit. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very hard for most men not to look unusually smart in a suit, this is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66c7el1E11o">great secret of men&#8217;s fashion</a>. &nbsp;Since London is the home of Savile Row and since I had a bit more money than I was used to, I thought maybe I could get a suit made.<br /><br />Thing is, Savile Row suits are expensive. &nbsp;And a computer programmer who works from home has very little call to ever actually wear one. &nbsp;And the whole reason I want to train as a valet is because I find ironing, folding, hanging and tending clothes both tedious and difficult. &nbsp;Even had I saved to get a tailored suit, it would probably have hung alone in my wardrobe while I sat slumped on the couch in my hoodie and jeans, eating yet another sticky toffee pudding. &nbsp;&#8220;And what if I ever lost weight?&#8221;, I&#8217;d think as I helped myself to another pint.<br /><br />Bespoke suits are not for me. &nbsp;Perhaps not bespoke anything. &nbsp;After all, to have something tailor-made will always be expensive, and thus reserved for the very wealthy or perhaps for those who <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/bespoke-tailor-explains-james-bonds-suits.html">need highly customized clothing</a>&nbsp;or equipment in order to truly excel. &nbsp;Maybe Djokovic has a custom tennis racket or something. <a href="http://xkcd.com/178/">I really wouldn&#8217;t know</a>.<br /><br />And yet, last night I was talking to a bunch of fellow geeks – professional programmers and sysadmins – about the way our computers are set up. &nbsp;We each use this weird editor or that obscure window manager, customized with an arsenal of scripts that we&#8217;ve honed over the previous years to the point where no one else would be able to actually use our computers. &nbsp;I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">don&#8217;t even use a QWERTY keyboard</a>. <br /><br />Our virtual environments have each been tailor-made by us, for us. &nbsp;They are like bespoke suits in that they are customized for a particular, unusually demanding, person. &nbsp;Just like someone else who tried to wear your tailored suit, anyone else who used our computers would feel distinctly uncomfortable. &nbsp;Indeed, many would find the computers entirely unusable.<br /><br />And yet the shoe doesn&#8217;t quite fit. &nbsp;I can wear my (sadly, still hypothetical) tailored suit, but I can wear something off the Marks &amp; Spencers rack just as easily. &nbsp;Likewise, just as most people would have difficulty using my customized setup, I struggle to use an off-the-shelf system. &nbsp;Not so much because my standards are high, but because my habits are _weird_. <br /><br />Most geeks I know are not fully comfortable in their desktop environments. &nbsp;There is always something that bugs them, something that could be done better, some process that&#8217;s more tedious than it needs to be. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t get that in a suit from the Row. &nbsp;The wearer is the tailor. &nbsp;The programmer makes programs with programs the programmer makes.<br /><br />Further, while the suit is made to fit the man, the adaptation in a computer environment goes both ways. &nbsp;As the programmer makes improvements to the environment, they learn how to navigate that environment better. &nbsp;Even the improvements made are reactionary and incremental, making it much more like a mutual growth than a made-to-measure suit.<br /><br />I guess the clue is in the name: my relationship to my unique environment is symbiotic. &nbsp;Which makes my brain fizz with questions: is advantage gained by being able to adapt your virtual environment to yourself as big as the advantage humanity has with adapting its physical environment? what about the isolation that comes from customization? as more people (I hope) know how to program, does that mean that more and more software will be programmable?<br /><br />And would you spring a couple of thousand quid to help me get a proper suit?<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: crisis.</div>

Not a bad approach in QLD.<br /><br />Can you manage saying &quot;pants&quot; with a straight face yet?  Over three years here and still have to mentally check myself and say &quot;trousers&quot;. </div>

I bought a made-to-measure suit to get married in.  It didn&#39;t fit properly and I was really unhappy with the result, but it was too late to get changed.  I&#39;ve resigned myself to thinking that I just have a body that ill-fits everything so I&#39;ll make do with shorts and flip flops (still can&#39;t bring myself to say th*ngs).</div>

Probably yes. Jolie &amp; I go to the opera a couple of times a year, and maybe a half-dozen other events where it&#39;s nice to wear a suit. It would be a ridiculous extravagance though.<br /><br />Savile Row tailor Thomas Mahon (whose two piece suits will set you back £2350) has a good article on &quot;What if you only have £200?&quot; at http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000101.html.  M&amp;S suits (hah!) my needs just fine.</div>

<br />I wish I had someone to blame other than myself for me being out in this miserable weather. &nbsp;You would think by now that I would have the good sense not to hit Oxford Street during the January sales and the worst snow since America decided that it needed some space to pursue its own creative interests.<br /><br />I still haven&#8217;t got used to the cold weather. &nbsp;I left my scarf at restaurant in Chinatown last week and I think I left one of my gloves at Mike&#8217;s house last week. &nbsp;Every four or five steps I take my foot slips a little and I worry that this is going to be the end. &nbsp;Any second now I&#8217;m going to fall backwards on to the pavement and spend my last freezing moments being tsked over by busy shoppers for blocking the footpath.<br /><br />We&#8217;re going to the opera tonight, you see. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never been before but a quick search suggests that jeans and a hoodie might not be quite the thing. &nbsp;Although it runs against my cave troll chic, I actually do own a suit. &nbsp;I tried it on earlier today, to be on the safe side. &nbsp;My fashion tip: skin-tight three-quarter length pinstripes in the forthcoming frosty day in hell season.<br /><br />Which, rather appropriately, has left me staggering around London&#8217;s busiest street with the tips of my fingers going numb and turning a slightly worrying shade of purple. &nbsp;Still, chin up old man, faint heart never won fair lady and all that. &nbsp;Oh look, churros.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />The world &#8211; slippery though it may be &#8211; is a better place when nourished by deep-fried choux and chocolate sauce. &nbsp;Let remorse wait until tomorrow, for today I have pastry! &nbsp;Also, I think I&#8217;ve smeared some chocolate on my smart phone screen.<br /><br />There&#8217;s apparently a men&#8217;s suit shop a couple of blocks from here that&#8217;s had some good reviews. &nbsp;I leave my warm, dougnutty haven and immediately almost slip over on the icey pavement. &nbsp;Only by frantically clutching the shoulders of a nearby stranger do I manage to stay upright. &nbsp;The little bugger seems upset with me. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why. &nbsp;When I was eight I would have been proud to rescue an elder from certain calamity.<br /><br />The shop is called Taunton&#8217;s. &nbsp;It&#8217;s on a little side street that&#8217;s just off a side street from Regent Street, down some all too slippery steps. &nbsp;The door opens and closes silently as I enter and air has a sort of musty closeness that reminds me of public libraries. &nbsp;At first I can&#8217;t see anyone or even a counter, just racks of suits and shelves full of shirts and ties.<br /><br />I must have wandered in further than I thought, because I hear a voice behind me utter the terrifying words, &#8220;Excuse me, sir. &nbsp;May I help you?&#8221;. &nbsp;I leap three feet into the air, spinning around and knocking over one of the racks in my surprise. &nbsp;I fumble a little while with the mess of jackets before the gentleman behind me reaches over and rights them. &nbsp;He is dressed in tweed and has a moustache that could have conquered Afghanistan for Queen Victoria.<br /><br />&#8220;May I help you, sir?&#8221;, he asks again. &nbsp;I hate this question. &nbsp;I can never get the answer right.<br /><br />&#8220;Uhh, yes, I was wondering if you sell suits?&#8221; &nbsp;Oh bollocks. &nbsp;At least I can hope they give points for effort. &nbsp;He glances quickly around the shop as if to acknowledge that my doubt was valid and that no matter how damning the circumstances, the question bore further investigation.<br /><br />&#8220;We do indeed, sir. &nbsp;Is there a particular type of suit that sir is looking for?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to the opera tonight and I need&#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ah yes sir, step right this way. &nbsp;I know just the thing to tempt you with.&#8221; &nbsp;He walks with a slight limp, leading me around a table covered in silk handkerchiefs to a separate room. &nbsp;He notices me looking at his dragging foot, &#8220;I had a nasty fall a few years back&#8221; and winks as if I&#8217;m supposed to get the joke.<br /><br />&#8220;This, sir, is our finest gentleman&#8217;s evening wear &#8211; ideal for the opera.&#8221; &nbsp;He gestures toward a mannequin dressed in the kind of dinner jacket that Bertie Wooster would have worn.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly sure. &nbsp;I mean, it does look a bit &#8230; formal. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to be over-dressed. &nbsp;It is only the ENO.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sir, if you&#8217;ll pardon me for saying so, as soon as you walk into the room wearing this, any other gentleman will be under-dressed.&#8221; &nbsp;He measures me as he&#8217;s speaking, and then produces a jacket, trousers, shirt and even shoes from various cupboards and drawers in the room.<br /><br />&#8220;Just try these on, sir, and see how they feel. I&#8217;ll guarantee you&#8217;ll never want anything else.&#8221; &nbsp;He somehow guides me toward the change room with my arms full of expensive cloth. &nbsp; What is it about salesmen that makes me go invertebrate? &nbsp;&#8220;Oh, and sir &#8230; ?&#8221; &nbsp;I turn around and he makes a sort of rubbing gesture on the side of his lip. &nbsp;I mimic him and feel some sticky chocolate sauce come off onto my finger. &nbsp;Oops.<br /><br />Anyway, I try on the suit and the devil is right, it does feel pretty good. &nbsp;How did he know my shoe size? &nbsp;As I leave I can feel a confidence in my step and a funny feeling in my shoulders that I can only guess is what not hunching feels like. (Cave troll, remember?)<br /><br />When I see myself in the mirror, I can hardly believe my eyes. &nbsp;I have never looked this good. &nbsp;Heck, I even look more clean shaven than I did in my street clothes.<br /><br />The salesman coughs politely. &nbsp;Although he is too tasteful to show it in his features, he has the air of a man who has finished the hardest part of a difficult job and finished it well. &nbsp; &#8220;How does that feel?&#8221;, he asks. &nbsp;In my head, I say that I don&#8217;t give a damn how it feels, it &#8211; I &#8211; look amazing, but I don&#8217;t want to give the game away.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s nice&#8221;, I say. &#8220;How much is it?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;The suit, together with the shirt, waistcoat and shoes comes to £7,600.&#8221; It&#8217;s a little hard to breathe in here, was it always so hot? &nbsp;&#8220;Excluding VAT.&#8221;<br /><br />I think I must have choked a little because the next thing I know the salesman is slapping me on the back and I&#8217;m coughing all over the place. &nbsp;As I come round, he steps back as if nothing had happened. &nbsp; &#8220;Of course, we also provide generous payment plans on instalments.&#8221;<br /><br />I simply can&#8217;t afford to spend that much money on a suit. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t spent that much money on anything ever. &nbsp;It&#8217;s ridiculous even thinking about it, me even being here is ludicrous. &nbsp;But looking in the mirror it&#8217;s so tempting. &nbsp;I look a million dollars, so paying only a few thousand pounds makes it a bargain, right?<br /><br />I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this, but I shrug my shoulders and nod. &nbsp;The gentleman leads me over to the sales counter where there&#8217;s a contract waiting next to an ink bottle and quill, of all things. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very long and full of Latin legal terms and I can&#8217;t say I bother to read the whole thing. &nbsp;After I sign, I feel an itching behind my eye. &nbsp;I start rubbing it and something small and shining and round falls out. &nbsp;Before I can see what it is, the salesman snatches it and puts it into a drawer beneath the counter.<br /><br />I start to ask him about it, but before I can he says, &#8220;Which opera is sir going to see tonight?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;My girlfriend picked it. &nbsp;Something by Berlitz? &nbsp;Belize?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ah, yes. &nbsp;Berlioz. &nbsp;&#8216;The Damnation of Faust&#8217;. &nbsp;A particular favourite of mine, sir. &nbsp;I trust you&#8217;ll enjoy it. &nbsp;Have a wonderful evening. &nbsp;I do so look forward to seeing you again.&#8221;<br /><br />I turn and find my way through the maze of the shop, back up the stairs to chilly London.<br /><br /></div>

I adore the language you&#39;ve used here Jonathan, well done. Perhaps consider rewording the second sentence of paragraph two. Your use of the time period &#39;last week&#39; twice in the same sentence detracts from an otherwise absorbing read. Or, perhaps it was just my OCD tendencies that drew me out of the story when I read that particular line.</div>

:)<br />Reading this made my morning, jml!<br />Wonderful imagery and warm, engaging language.<br />Loved it!<br />(although I was hoping that you&#39;d offer (in a Scottish accent) to pay for your suit of clothes with an ancient pearl earring removed directly from your earlobe!)</div>

<br />A funny thing happened to me the other day. &nbsp;I was sitting on my couch,&nbsp;waiting for an unusually long test run to complete and looking for&nbsp;something to keep me out of trouble when I glanced over at Jolie&#8217;s&nbsp;motorcycle magazine.<br /><br />Jolie doesn&#8217;t normally read motorcycle magazines, or magazines in&nbsp;general really, but she got this particular magazine for a special&nbsp;purpose. &nbsp;You see, she took her bike into the dealer for its MOT the&nbsp;other day and it turns out that everything is wrong with it except the&nbsp;engine. &nbsp;The mechanics say that it&#8217;ll cost so many pounds to replace the parts and&nbsp;the bike only cost a little more than that, so now she&#8217;s in the market for a new bike, and&nbsp;she&#8217;s looking at bike magazines to see what she can get.<br /><br />Anyway, the magazine was open (ever heard that excuse before?), and the&nbsp;page it happens to be open on is an opinion piece called &#8220;Women and the&nbsp;art of riding &#8230; fast&#8221;. &nbsp;There&#8217;s some big text in the middle saying&nbsp;&#8220;Jane Austen couldn&#8217;t have won MotoGP. &nbsp;But maybe soon a woman will come&nbsp;along who can compete at the top.&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;m quite a fan of Jane Austen and&nbsp;hate to see her put down like that. &nbsp;Also, I am intrigued, because&nbsp;everything about bikes that I didn&#8217;t already learn from <i>Zen</i> and the&nbsp;art of same I learned from my wife.<br /><br />Turns out the guy has a claim, that women bikers are fundamentally&nbsp;different to men bikers. &nbsp;He has a lot of stories to back it up, too.&nbsp;Like when he was a kid, other kids said &#8220;chicks dig bikes&#8221; but actually&nbsp;they—the chicks, not the kids—dug cars instead. &nbsp;Or how he asked&nbsp;his wife if she&#8217;d still ride when he died and she said no, it would be&nbsp;too much fuss. &nbsp;Or how some woman win some bike competitions sometimes.&nbsp;Cool stories, no?<br /><br />He goes on to quote his wife saying that women aren&#8217;t evolved to respond&nbsp;to stress with increased vigilance and a readiness to fight, the way&nbsp;that men are. &nbsp;Which kind of clinches it really.<br /><br />The poor guy has to fill a page with text once a month—I feel for&nbsp;him, I really do. &nbsp;I still can&#8217;t help but wish that he&#8217;d have given a&nbsp;local boffin a ring or something. &nbsp;It&#8217;s never going to be Pulitzer&nbsp;material, but at least you could make it look like you&#8217;ve put some&nbsp;effort in. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a rare day that a bit of a think and a quick chat with&nbsp;your spouse is going to challenge your fundamental assumptions about&nbsp;anything, so if you&#8217;re going to write about gender equality as<br />pertaining to competitive motorcycle racing you might as well do a quick&nbsp;search on Wikipedia. &nbsp;You might learn something.<br /><br />Still, it&#8217;s the nature of the genre, isn&#8217;t it? &nbsp;You&#8217;re never going to&nbsp;get cutting edge scientific journalism in the pages of <i>Bike</i>, and even&nbsp;if you did it would still be glued together with warm stories of human&nbsp;interest, as per the standard formula.<br /><br />And then I found a fiver.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: Bargain.</div>

Keen readers of Echo &amp; Bounce will notice two things about the last two posts:<br /><br /><ol><li>they were unusually close together</li><li>neither were about books I&#8217;ve just read</li></ol><div>Although, to be fair, I mention books in one of them.</div><div><br /></div><div>As documented previously, I&#8217;m participating in the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>. The first word, picked in an all-too-frequent attack of stupidity by yours truly, was &#8220;ambition&#8221;. My take, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/ambition.html">previously</a>, and <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice&#8217;s take on his blog</a>. My next word will not be so high falutin.</div><div><br /></div><div>The word for next week, picked by Bice, is &#8220;anecdote&#8221;. I looked it up, and it doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;a cure for poison&#8221;, so I&#8217;m out of ideas.</div><div><br /></div><div>As Bice <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/2013/01/the-year-of-writing-dangerously.html">mentions</a>, there&#8217;s no great way to follow both his posts and mine at this stage: no doubt we&#8217;ll over-engineer a solution some time after the year is out. In the mean time, you probably want to follow him. We&#8217;ll both try to label our posts with alphabet-supremacy, so you can spot the relevant ones.</div></div>

I think about ambition every now and then. &nbsp;It&#8217;s an important thing in my&nbsp;life and something I dearly wish I could better understand. &nbsp;When I think&nbsp;about it, two people come to mind. Both are fictional, and both are drunks.<br /><br />The first is from <i>Macbeth</i>.&nbsp;When we were studying it, we eventually got to Act 2, Scene 3, where&nbsp;Porter shows up to provide some comic relief for the groundlings.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, &nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />That you do lie so late?<br /><br />Porter&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />&#8216;Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock: and drink,  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />sir, is a great provoker of three things.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />What three things does drink especially provoke?<br /><br />PORTER &nbsp; <br />Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.<br />Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes<br />the desire, but it takes away the performance: there-<br />fore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator<br />with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets&nbsp;him<br />on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and dis-<br />heartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in<br />conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the<br />lie, leaves him.<br /><br /><br />I don&#8217;t have many memories of distinct episodes from high school. &nbsp;I can&nbsp;remember the people, and what I learnt, and practically every embarrassing&nbsp;thing I said or did. &nbsp;This hits all three.<br /><br /><br />Our teacher, Mrs Keates, told us (in a fashion I have since learned is common&nbsp;to English teachers everywhere) that this wasn&#8217;t merely bad comedy but that it&nbsp;had a Deeper Significance. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i>, as it turns out, is a play largely&nbsp;about ambition, perhaps best highlighted in Macbeth&#8217;s claim that he has &#8220;no spur to prick the sides of [his] intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o&#8217;erleaps itself and falls on th&#8217;other&#8221;.<br /><br />And just as a rider who too eagerly tries to mount a horse and falls on the&nbsp;other side, or as a man incited to lasciviousness by too much liquor, the&nbsp;attempt to succeed is doomed to fail.<br /><br />I was a lot younger than the others in my English class, and knew little of&nbsp;lechery or drink. &nbsp;I did know something of ambition however. &nbsp;I wanted to get&nbsp;out of small, dry, dusty Kingaroy, to see the world and to learn everything&nbsp;that it was possible to learn.<br /><br />Because I didn&#8217;t understand the porter&#8217;s joke, and because I wanted to learn,&nbsp;I stayed after class to ask Mrs Keates what she was getting at. &nbsp;She&nbsp;explained, and did a fantastic job of masking her amusement. &nbsp;To this day, I&nbsp;can&#8217;t remember what she said, but I walked away embarrassed and knowing a bit&nbsp;more about lechery and drink than I&#8217;d be able to benefit from for some years.<br /><br />I still don&#8217;t know what to think about <i>Macbeth</i>&#8217;s condemnation of ambition,&nbsp;as being entirely free of it doesn&#8217;t work either. &nbsp;The other fictitious drunk&nbsp;that I was reminded of is Sydney Carton, from <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. &nbsp;His&nbsp;defining trait is his lack of ambition. &nbsp;He wastes away his talents while his&nbsp;boss, Stryver (!), benefits from them. &nbsp;So much so that there&#8217;s a sense in&nbsp;which his famous last words aren&#8217;t saying much. &nbsp;Giving his life for Charles&nbsp;Darnay must be a far better thing than he has done, because it&#8217;s the <i>only&nbsp;</i>thing he has done.<br /><br />I do not want to end with luke-warm Dumbledorizing that too much is&nbsp;bad, and too little bad also. &nbsp;Perhaps ambition is dignified or diminished by&nbsp;its object? &nbsp;There&#8217;s something in this. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i> shows that any gains you&nbsp;make by striving for the sake of yourself are ultimately hollow. &nbsp;The apostles&nbsp;also frequently warn against &#8220;selfish ambition&#8221;.<br /><br />But to leave it there isn&#8217;t enough. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just the aim of the ambition but&nbsp;the force behind it. &nbsp;Shakespeare also catches on the unruliness of the&nbsp;desire, the way it governs you rather than you it, and leaves you at its&nbsp;mercy.<br /><br />In this, Macbeth and Sydney Carton have something in common, as Carton&#8217;s crush&nbsp;on Lucie Manette has the same self-defeating properties as Macbeth&#8217;s ambition.&nbsp;He&#8217;s consumed by it and rendered powerless by it. &nbsp;Boyish Crush is the lanky&nbsp;nephew of Drunken Lechery.<br /><br />All of which perhaps explain what makes some ambition bad, but doesn&#8217;t say&nbsp;much about what makes it good. &nbsp;What is it that we admire about the ambition&nbsp;we see in others? &nbsp;In ourselves? &nbsp;How do we prevent our own noble ambitions –&nbsp;if there truly is such a thing – from losing their way and perhaps causing us&nbsp;to lose ours? &nbsp;A lack of time and a lack of insight conspire to prevent me&nbsp;from answering.<br /><br />Shortly after I finished high school, my family left Kingaroy for Tasmania,&nbsp;and in the years since I&#8217;ve seen much of the world. &nbsp;I still don&#8217;t know&nbsp;everything, but it&#8217;s something to aim for, right?<br /><div><br /></div></div>
