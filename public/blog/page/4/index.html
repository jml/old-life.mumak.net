<i>Late, and I&#8217;m not at all happy with the result.</i>&nbsp;<i>However, <a href="https://twitter.com/metagnome/status/303298910263316480">Bice has called me on it</a>, so here it is.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><br /></i><br />When Richard awoke, he was not in his bedroom, which was the customary place for him to rise. Nor was he in any bedroom that he recognized, although if you quizzed him on it, you would learn that there weren&#8217;t that many that he could. Indeed was he not in any bedroom at all.<br /><br />Instead, he was in a sitting room, lying flat on the floor and staring at an ornate ceiling that appeared to be moving. &nbsp;This was not what he expected. The last thing he remembered was playing a friendly game of cards in the home of a well-to-do clergyman, or someone of that ilk.<br /><br />He peeled himself off the carpet, woozed lurchingly to his feet and looked around. &nbsp;The room was furnished in the older style, with an ornamental ceiling, too many chairs, and all of it in angry mustards and burgundies and pink pinstripes. &nbsp;It was enough to give one a headache.<br /><br />There weren&#8217;t any windows to the room, which struck Richard as odd. &nbsp;There was a door though. &nbsp;It was a simple affair compared to the garish colours and &nbsp;patterns of the rest of the room. &nbsp;The handle had a curve chosen to match the crest of the chaise longue and the swooping legs of the chairs and tea tables that seemed to be everywhere in the room.<br /><br />And yet, whatever symmetry intended by the deranged mind behind the decor for the room was marred by the bulbous and ungainly body slumbering unquietly in the opposite corner.<br /><br />Richard quickly tried the handle. &nbsp;His memories of last night were only slowly returning to his fogged mind, but the snoring hillock of flesh in the corner was hard to forget. &nbsp;The door was locked, naturally. &nbsp;Some deep, reptilian reaction made him shake frantically at the handle, only to stop immediately as the more rational fear of waking the beast began to take hold.<br /><br />If only we were sooner gripped by our better doubts! &nbsp;The gelatinous mountain stirred, rising on its hind-quarters and emitting a bellow that rattled Richard&#8217;s teeth.<br /><br />&#8220;Jacob, what a delight to see you&#8221;, said Richard, demonstrating that he was not incapable of deceit.<br /><br />&#8220;Richard? Yes. Good. What time is it? Where&#8217;s Smith? Right.&#8221; Even at the best of times, Jacob tended to spare his interlocutor the difficulty of replying to his enquiries, and it appeared that immediately after rising was far from that. &nbsp;Richard tensed his legs, ready to run even though there was nowhere to run to. &nbsp;Any minute now, Jacob would remember.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;Oh?&#8221;, said Richard, as some answer seemed to be expected.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money&#8221;, Jacob repeated, wagging his finger &#8211; which happened to be nearly the same size, shape and colour as an uncooked Cumberland sausage &#8211; at Richard. &nbsp;As he said this, he stepped forward and knocked over one of the ridiculous chairs, its leg snapping under his heel.<br /><br />Richard edged back slowly toward the door. &nbsp;If one were given to a sort of narrow-minded, technical, hopelessly out-dated, moralistic way of putting things then, yes, one could say he had taken Jacob&#8217;s money. &nbsp;Richard himself preferred to think that anyone who sat down to an obviously fixed game of cards instead gave him money. &nbsp;It implied a generosity of spirit that did Jacob credit.<br /><br />Still, occasionally one must sacrifice nobility of sentiment on the altar of rude circumstance. &nbsp;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t <i>take</i> your money&#8221;, Richard lied, &#8220;I was merely looking after it for you.&#8221; &nbsp;He wouldn&#8217;t fall for that, but perhaps it would delay the beating for long enough for someone to open this blasted door and rescue him.<br /><br />&#8220;Is that so? &nbsp;Well, return it to me now and I might even thank you for it.&#8221; Richard didn&#8217;t believe him, but reached for the winnings anyway. &nbsp;Desperate times and all that.<br /><br />It wasn&#8217;t there. &nbsp;Richard stumbled sideways over a too dainty table, fell over and quivered back up again. &nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t have it on me&#8221;. &nbsp;But where the hell was it? &nbsp;&#8220;Carrying that much lucre on my person would be both demeaning and foolhardy&#8221;. &nbsp;After the game, his partner Smith had left, leaving him with the two they had just rinsed. &nbsp;Why had he done that? &nbsp;Jacob&#8217;s hands were perilously close to his throat. &nbsp;&#8220;I was afraid that we would both fall to drink and so hid the money elsewhere, to protect it from our worser selves.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money, and you lost it&#8221;. &nbsp;Normally Richard would prize such clarity of thought.<br /><br />&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t lose it. &nbsp;Someone must have stolen it. &nbsp;Why else would we be imprisoned here?&#8221;<br /><br />Jacob looked confused, as if their situation had only just occurred to him. He went to the door to open it. &nbsp;The handle was tiny in his hands, but despite his turning, shaking, and pulling, the door remained firmly shut. &nbsp;He banged on the door, shouted and waited, yet no one answered.<br /><br />&#8220;You took my money, lost it, and trapped us both.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, we are both trapped together, although I do not know how it came to be, or even where we are.&#8221;<br /><br />Even as he spoke, a key rattle in the lock. &nbsp;Richard spun around, and James orbited on his axis. &nbsp;The door began to open.<br /><div style="font-style: italic;"><br /></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><br /></div></div>

I really like this, actually, although I can easily imagine how frustrating a piece it was to write.<br /><br />&quot;Richard himself preferred to think that anyone who sat down to an obviously fixed game of cards instead gave him money.  It implied a generosity of spirit that did Jacob credit.&quot; ← very nice.</div>

<br />I&#8217;m going to be brutally honest. &nbsp;It&#8217;s 9pm on a Sunday, I&#8217;ve just come in from the cold and the rain, I&#8217;m exhausted from four nights on the trot with little sleep and I&#8217;m in the middle of a good book. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to be sitting here and writing, but I&#8217;m doing it anyway. &nbsp;As much as I want to curl up with a Baileys and some Brahms, I can&#8217;t bring myself to let this deadline pass without some effort to meet it. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to admit defeat.<br /><br />It&#8217;s tempting to add &#8220;not to Bice&#8221; to that, but it would only be for dramatic effect. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve played countless games of many kinds against Bice and have almost certainly lost the majority of them. &nbsp;If there were any shame in losing to him, it&#8217;s a shame to which I&#8217;ve become well accustomed.<br /><br />Setting aside our many rounds of Soul Calibur 2, where I feel that the vast disparity of scores exaggerates the true difference in skill, the games we&#8217;ve mostly competed in have been board games. &nbsp;Long, strategic board games with many players like <i>Civilisation</i>, <i>Risk</i>, or <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Thrones-Board-2nd-Edition/dp/1589947207/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360533882&amp;sr=8-1">Game of Thrones</a></i>.<br /><br />The way it works is like this. &nbsp;Bice, Chris, myself and at least one person named James will gather around a table and set it up. &nbsp;The person named James is sometimes my brother, sometimes my friend James Whelan. &nbsp;The role of the James is to act as my nemesis. &nbsp;If there is more than one James present, then the only difficulty is figuring out what the plural of &#8216;nemesis&#8217; is. &nbsp;Also &#8216;James&#8217;.<br /><br />Before the game, the James will warn the other players against my notorious abilities and to urge them to unite against me. &nbsp;During the opening, they will seize upon my economy of motion and speed of decision making as examples that – unless I&#8217;m stopped by extraordinary means – my victory is certain.<br /><br />Then the game will progress to the middle phase, where at least one James will hurl everything he&#8217;s got at me, sabotaging whatever manoeuvres I had planned and leaving both of our forces greatly diminished and my spirit crushed by the irrationality and the sheer unfairness of it all.<br /><br />Broken now in mind, robbed of strength, and probably never actually being that good in the first place my game quickly crumbles and I&#8217;m soon eliminated. Whichever James attacked me is wiped out shortly after that.<br /><br />Then Chris wins.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m bitter, it&#8217;s not that I mind losing to Chris, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m just convinced that if only I could throw off the shackles of my Jacobion Nemesi (or Nemetical Jameses) I could lose on my own terms in more interesting ways. &nbsp;I enjoy their company (and indeed, &nbsp;competing against them) too much to ever try to exclude them from playing, but I do sometimes hope that maybe this will be the game where Reason rules and I don&#8217;t get ganged up on in the early phases. (OK, I <i>am</i> bitter, but I really don&#8217;t mind losing to Chris)<br /><br />Phew. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been wanting to get that off my chest for a long time. &nbsp;Thanks.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word is &#8220;door&#8221;.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

<br /><b>Disclaimer:</b> I realize that by any sane judgment, my life is so amazingly free of problems that I might as well be cavorting about in the strawberry patches of Elysium, singing counterpoint with the Butterflies of Jubilation that accompany me always. &nbsp;My own knowledge of real trouble, real suffering is so slight that I ought to remain silent on the subject. &nbsp;Yet I hope I have something to say about the more shallow difficulties that we all face.<br /><br /><br />As the philosopher said, shit happens. &nbsp;This life inevitably has difficulty, danger, and disaster, and when these things happen, they don&#8217;t feel like part of the grand tragi-comic symphony of humanity, they just plain suck.<br /><br />However, if I get to choose how my problems come to me, and I&#8217;m choosing based on my<br />own selfish comfort, then deal them to me as one crisis after another.<br /><br />A crisis is obvious, and that&#8217;s always a good start. &nbsp;We can look at it, and go, &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s a crisis all right. &nbsp;Better get onto it.&#8221; &nbsp;The alternative is slow, seeping, dripping problems that we don&#8217;t notice until it&#8217;s too late, or worse yet, static ever-present problems that we are only half-conscious of and become a kind of background music of suck, like a television that&#8217;s on in another room that we can&#8217;t be bothered to turn off.<br /><br />An example is being overweight. &nbsp;For most of my life, I&#8217;ve been carrying around an unhealthy amount of body fat, and I&#8217;ve always been unhappy about it. (I told you my problems were shallow). As <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/bespoke.html">I mentioned last week</a>, when I moved to the UK I started putting on even more weight. &nbsp;Eventually, I took a couple of weeks off work with the express intent of using the second week to kick off a habit of eating more healthily and doing some exercise. &nbsp;In a sense, I had to force a crisis, and even then it took me years to do so.<br /><br />On the other hand, if I had at some point in my past been thin and then woken up one day with an extra forty kilos of flab, I&#8217;m fairly certain I would have take action that same day.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also a buzz that you get from tackling a crisis. &nbsp;The stakes are high, the clock is running, and every action is weighed with significance. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just that we feel like important people doing important things – although it is at least that – but also that our attention is completely engrossed. &nbsp;When a calamity descends upon us while we are in the middle of another, our first reaction is how unfair it is. &nbsp;Perhaps that&#8217;s partly because we resent the<br />disruption of that perfect, rapt attention? &nbsp;If we handle the crisis well, then there&#8217;s also a feeling of mastery. &nbsp;We were hit with the worst, but we gave it our best and we came out on top.<br /><br />Even emotional crises have a perverse buzz: it&#8217;s not for nothing that we speak of &#8220;wallowing&#8221; in self pity. &nbsp;And even if we avoid that, there&#8217;s something welcome about the way such a crisis can simplify things. &nbsp;People often say &#8220;it makes you realize what&#8217;s really important&#8221;.<br /><br />And not only does the crisis make us feel significant and competent, but often it makes others (for a happy moment!) look on us the same way. &nbsp;Someone who averts disaster in the nick of time is a hero, someone who takes a broken, ruined situation and turns it around is a saviour. &nbsp;If we handle a crisis well, we are commended by others – often even if it was a result of our negligence!<br /><br />So for the status, for the mental clarity, for the rush, and because it&#8217;s much easier than trying to identify and correct any other kind of problem, give me a crisis any day.<br /><br />But please, one at a time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div><b>The Alphabet Supremacy</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>This post would not have happened without the artificially induced crisis brought about by the&nbsp;<a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>&nbsp;project that I&#8217;m doing with&nbsp;<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.

It&#39;s also worth mentioning where a few of these ideas came from:<br /><br />On attention, <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Confessions</i> by St Augustine, <i>Getting Things Done</i> by David Allen.<br /><br />On mastery, <i>Drive</i> by Dan Pink (I&#39;ve only watched the animation), <i>Flow</i> by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, <i>Creating Passionate Users</i> by Kathy Sierra.<br /><br />On the feeling of significance and the dangers therein, talking to any decent sysadmin.<br /></div>

<br />It was the spring of 2009, and I&#8217;d just moved to London. &nbsp;Which made it the autumn of 2009. &nbsp;I had got a promotion at work. &nbsp;No longer an engineer on Launchpad, I was now its Product Strategist, and thus was moving to the UK.<br /><br />Moving to London was a big change. &nbsp;If you are like me, then any big move triggers questions about what other things you could change, apart from your location. &nbsp;Perhaps I&#8217;ll join a gym when I get there, or maybe try to cook more – things like that.<br /><br />One change that I thought about a lot was dressing better. &nbsp;Or at least, looking back it seems that way. &nbsp;What actually happened was I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronbentley/4291810841/">grew my hair long and gained five or ten kilos</a>. &nbsp;In my memory, though, I distinctly recall thinking about smartening up my look. &nbsp;What can you do?<br /><br />In particular, I wanted to start wearing suits – good suits. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d look great in a good suit. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very hard for most men not to look unusually smart in a suit, this is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66c7el1E11o">great secret of men&#8217;s fashion</a>. &nbsp;Since London is the home of Savile Row and since I had a bit more money than I was used to, I thought maybe I could get a suit made.<br /><br />Thing is, Savile Row suits are expensive. &nbsp;And a computer programmer who works from home has very little call to ever actually wear one. &nbsp;And the whole reason I want to train as a valet is because I find ironing, folding, hanging and tending clothes both tedious and difficult. &nbsp;Even had I saved to get a tailored suit, it would probably have hung alone in my wardrobe while I sat slumped on the couch in my hoodie and jeans, eating yet another sticky toffee pudding. &nbsp;&#8220;And what if I ever lost weight?&#8221;, I&#8217;d think as I helped myself to another pint.<br /><br />Bespoke suits are not for me. &nbsp;Perhaps not bespoke anything. &nbsp;After all, to have something tailor-made will always be expensive, and thus reserved for the very wealthy or perhaps for those who <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/bespoke-tailor-explains-james-bonds-suits.html">need highly customized clothing</a>&nbsp;or equipment in order to truly excel. &nbsp;Maybe Djokovic has a custom tennis racket or something. <a href="http://xkcd.com/178/">I really wouldn&#8217;t know</a>.<br /><br />And yet, last night I was talking to a bunch of fellow geeks – professional programmers and sysadmins – about the way our computers are set up. &nbsp;We each use this weird editor or that obscure window manager, customized with an arsenal of scripts that we&#8217;ve honed over the previous years to the point where no one else would be able to actually use our computers. &nbsp;I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">don&#8217;t even use a QWERTY keyboard</a>. <br /><br />Our virtual environments have each been tailor-made by us, for us. &nbsp;They are like bespoke suits in that they are customized for a particular, unusually demanding, person. &nbsp;Just like someone else who tried to wear your tailored suit, anyone else who used our computers would feel distinctly uncomfortable. &nbsp;Indeed, many would find the computers entirely unusable.<br /><br />And yet the shoe doesn&#8217;t quite fit. &nbsp;I can wear my (sadly, still hypothetical) tailored suit, but I can wear something off the Marks &amp; Spencers rack just as easily. &nbsp;Likewise, just as most people would have difficulty using my customized setup, I struggle to use an off-the-shelf system. &nbsp;Not so much because my standards are high, but because my habits are _weird_. <br /><br />Most geeks I know are not fully comfortable in their desktop environments. &nbsp;There is always something that bugs them, something that could be done better, some process that&#8217;s more tedious than it needs to be. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t get that in a suit from the Row. &nbsp;The wearer is the tailor. &nbsp;The programmer makes programs with programs the programmer makes.<br /><br />Further, while the suit is made to fit the man, the adaptation in a computer environment goes both ways. &nbsp;As the programmer makes improvements to the environment, they learn how to navigate that environment better. &nbsp;Even the improvements made are reactionary and incremental, making it much more like a mutual growth than a made-to-measure suit.<br /><br />I guess the clue is in the name: my relationship to my unique environment is symbiotic. &nbsp;Which makes my brain fizz with questions: is advantage gained by being able to adapt your virtual environment to yourself as big as the advantage humanity has with adapting its physical environment? what about the isolation that comes from customization? as more people (I hope) know how to program, does that mean that more and more software will be programmable?<br /><br />And would you spring a couple of thousand quid to help me get a proper suit?<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: crisis.</div>

Not a bad approach in QLD.<br /><br />Can you manage saying &quot;pants&quot; with a straight face yet?  Over three years here and still have to mentally check myself and say &quot;trousers&quot;. </div>

I bought a made-to-measure suit to get married in.  It didn&#39;t fit properly and I was really unhappy with the result, but it was too late to get changed.  I&#39;ve resigned myself to thinking that I just have a body that ill-fits everything so I&#39;ll make do with shorts and flip flops (still can&#39;t bring myself to say th*ngs).</div>

Probably yes. Jolie &amp; I go to the opera a couple of times a year, and maybe a half-dozen other events where it&#39;s nice to wear a suit. It would be a ridiculous extravagance though.<br /><br />Savile Row tailor Thomas Mahon (whose two piece suits will set you back £2350) has a good article on &quot;What if you only have £200?&quot; at http://www.englishcut.com/archives/000101.html.  M&amp;S suits (hah!) my needs just fine.</div>

<br />I wish I had someone to blame other than myself for me being out in this miserable weather. &nbsp;You would think by now that I would have the good sense not to hit Oxford Street during the January sales and the worst snow since America decided that it needed some space to pursue its own creative interests.<br /><br />I still haven&#8217;t got used to the cold weather. &nbsp;I left my scarf at restaurant in Chinatown last week and I think I left one of my gloves at Mike&#8217;s house last week. &nbsp;Every four or five steps I take my foot slips a little and I worry that this is going to be the end. &nbsp;Any second now I&#8217;m going to fall backwards on to the pavement and spend my last freezing moments being tsked over by busy shoppers for blocking the footpath.<br /><br />We&#8217;re going to the opera tonight, you see. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never been before but a quick search suggests that jeans and a hoodie might not be quite the thing. &nbsp;Although it runs against my cave troll chic, I actually do own a suit. &nbsp;I tried it on earlier today, to be on the safe side. &nbsp;My fashion tip: skin-tight three-quarter length pinstripes in the forthcoming frosty day in hell season.<br /><br />Which, rather appropriately, has left me staggering around London&#8217;s busiest street with the tips of my fingers going numb and turning a slightly worrying shade of purple. &nbsp;Still, chin up old man, faint heart never won fair lady and all that. &nbsp;Oh look, churros.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />The world &#8211; slippery though it may be &#8211; is a better place when nourished by deep-fried choux and chocolate sauce. &nbsp;Let remorse wait until tomorrow, for today I have pastry! &nbsp;Also, I think I&#8217;ve smeared some chocolate on my smart phone screen.<br /><br />There&#8217;s apparently a men&#8217;s suit shop a couple of blocks from here that&#8217;s had some good reviews. &nbsp;I leave my warm, dougnutty haven and immediately almost slip over on the icey pavement. &nbsp;Only by frantically clutching the shoulders of a nearby stranger do I manage to stay upright. &nbsp;The little bugger seems upset with me. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why. &nbsp;When I was eight I would have been proud to rescue an elder from certain calamity.<br /><br />The shop is called Taunton&#8217;s. &nbsp;It&#8217;s on a little side street that&#8217;s just off a side street from Regent Street, down some all too slippery steps. &nbsp;The door opens and closes silently as I enter and air has a sort of musty closeness that reminds me of public libraries. &nbsp;At first I can&#8217;t see anyone or even a counter, just racks of suits and shelves full of shirts and ties.<br /><br />I must have wandered in further than I thought, because I hear a voice behind me utter the terrifying words, &#8220;Excuse me, sir. &nbsp;May I help you?&#8221;. &nbsp;I leap three feet into the air, spinning around and knocking over one of the racks in my surprise. &nbsp;I fumble a little while with the mess of jackets before the gentleman behind me reaches over and rights them. &nbsp;He is dressed in tweed and has a moustache that could have conquered Afghanistan for Queen Victoria.<br /><br />&#8220;May I help you, sir?&#8221;, he asks again. &nbsp;I hate this question. &nbsp;I can never get the answer right.<br /><br />&#8220;Uhh, yes, I was wondering if you sell suits?&#8221; &nbsp;Oh bollocks. &nbsp;At least I can hope they give points for effort. &nbsp;He glances quickly around the shop as if to acknowledge that my doubt was valid and that no matter how damning the circumstances, the question bore further investigation.<br /><br />&#8220;We do indeed, sir. &nbsp;Is there a particular type of suit that sir is looking for?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to the opera tonight and I need&#8211;&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ah yes sir, step right this way. &nbsp;I know just the thing to tempt you with.&#8221; &nbsp;He walks with a slight limp, leading me around a table covered in silk handkerchiefs to a separate room. &nbsp;He notices me looking at his dragging foot, &#8220;I had a nasty fall a few years back&#8221; and winks as if I&#8217;m supposed to get the joke.<br /><br />&#8220;This, sir, is our finest gentleman&#8217;s evening wear &#8211; ideal for the opera.&#8221; &nbsp;He gestures toward a mannequin dressed in the kind of dinner jacket that Bertie Wooster would have worn.<br /><br />&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly sure. &nbsp;I mean, it does look a bit &#8230; formal. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want to be over-dressed. &nbsp;It is only the ENO.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Sir, if you&#8217;ll pardon me for saying so, as soon as you walk into the room wearing this, any other gentleman will be under-dressed.&#8221; &nbsp;He measures me as he&#8217;s speaking, and then produces a jacket, trousers, shirt and even shoes from various cupboards and drawers in the room.<br /><br />&#8220;Just try these on, sir, and see how they feel. I&#8217;ll guarantee you&#8217;ll never want anything else.&#8221; &nbsp;He somehow guides me toward the change room with my arms full of expensive cloth. &nbsp; What is it about salesmen that makes me go invertebrate? &nbsp;&#8220;Oh, and sir &#8230; ?&#8221; &nbsp;I turn around and he makes a sort of rubbing gesture on the side of his lip. &nbsp;I mimic him and feel some sticky chocolate sauce come off onto my finger. &nbsp;Oops.<br /><br />Anyway, I try on the suit and the devil is right, it does feel pretty good. &nbsp;How did he know my shoe size? &nbsp;As I leave I can feel a confidence in my step and a funny feeling in my shoulders that I can only guess is what not hunching feels like. (Cave troll, remember?)<br /><br />When I see myself in the mirror, I can hardly believe my eyes. &nbsp;I have never looked this good. &nbsp;Heck, I even look more clean shaven than I did in my street clothes.<br /><br />The salesman coughs politely. &nbsp;Although he is too tasteful to show it in his features, he has the air of a man who has finished the hardest part of a difficult job and finished it well. &nbsp; &#8220;How does that feel?&#8221;, he asks. &nbsp;In my head, I say that I don&#8217;t give a damn how it feels, it &#8211; I &#8211; look amazing, but I don&#8217;t want to give the game away.<br /><br />&#8220;It&#8217;s nice&#8221;, I say. &#8220;How much is it?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;The suit, together with the shirt, waistcoat and shoes comes to £7,600.&#8221; It&#8217;s a little hard to breathe in here, was it always so hot? &nbsp;&#8220;Excluding VAT.&#8221;<br /><br />I think I must have choked a little because the next thing I know the salesman is slapping me on the back and I&#8217;m coughing all over the place. &nbsp;As I come round, he steps back as if nothing had happened. &nbsp; &#8220;Of course, we also provide generous payment plans on instalments.&#8221;<br /><br />I simply can&#8217;t afford to spend that much money on a suit. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t spent that much money on anything ever. &nbsp;It&#8217;s ridiculous even thinking about it, me even being here is ludicrous. &nbsp;But looking in the mirror it&#8217;s so tempting. &nbsp;I look a million dollars, so paying only a few thousand pounds makes it a bargain, right?<br /><br />I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this, but I shrug my shoulders and nod. &nbsp;The gentleman leads me over to the sales counter where there&#8217;s a contract waiting next to an ink bottle and quill, of all things. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very long and full of Latin legal terms and I can&#8217;t say I bother to read the whole thing. &nbsp;After I sign, I feel an itching behind my eye. &nbsp;I start rubbing it and something small and shining and round falls out. &nbsp;Before I can see what it is, the salesman snatches it and puts it into a drawer beneath the counter.<br /><br />I start to ask him about it, but before I can he says, &#8220;Which opera is sir going to see tonight?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;To be honest, I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;My girlfriend picked it. &nbsp;Something by Berlitz? &nbsp;Belize?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ah, yes. &nbsp;Berlioz. &nbsp;&#8216;The Damnation of Faust&#8217;. &nbsp;A particular favourite of mine, sir. &nbsp;I trust you&#8217;ll enjoy it. &nbsp;Have a wonderful evening. &nbsp;I do so look forward to seeing you again.&#8221;<br /><br />I turn and find my way through the maze of the shop, back up the stairs to chilly London.<br /><br /></div>

I adore the language you&#39;ve used here Jonathan, well done. Perhaps consider rewording the second sentence of paragraph two. Your use of the time period &#39;last week&#39; twice in the same sentence detracts from an otherwise absorbing read. Or, perhaps it was just my OCD tendencies that drew me out of the story when I read that particular line.</div>

Hey Al,<br /><br />So glad you liked it!<br /><br />Also, I&#39;ve sat here puzzling for a good few minutes and can&#39;t place the earring reference. Where&#39;s it from?<br /><br />jml</div>

I don&#39;t think Wodehouse will be too perturbed :)<br /><br />PS: please please *please* don&#39;t slip over in the street while inhabiting your suit. Perhaps you need a cane as well&#8230;</div>

:)<br />Reading this made my morning, jml!<br />Wonderful imagery and warm, engaging language.<br />Loved it!<br />(although I was hoping that you&#39;d offer (in a Scottish accent) to pay for your suit of clothes with an ancient pearl earring removed directly from your earlobe!)</div>

<br />A funny thing happened to me the other day. &nbsp;I was sitting on my couch,&nbsp;waiting for an unusually long test run to complete and looking for&nbsp;something to keep me out of trouble when I glanced over at Jolie&#8217;s&nbsp;motorcycle magazine.<br /><br />Jolie doesn&#8217;t normally read motorcycle magazines, or magazines in&nbsp;general really, but she got this particular magazine for a special&nbsp;purpose. &nbsp;You see, she took her bike into the dealer for its MOT the&nbsp;other day and it turns out that everything is wrong with it except the&nbsp;engine. &nbsp;The mechanics say that it&#8217;ll cost so many pounds to replace the parts and&nbsp;the bike only cost a little more than that, so now she&#8217;s in the market for a new bike, and&nbsp;she&#8217;s looking at bike magazines to see what she can get.<br /><br />Anyway, the magazine was open (ever heard that excuse before?), and the&nbsp;page it happens to be open on is an opinion piece called &#8220;Women and the&nbsp;art of riding &#8230; fast&#8221;. &nbsp;There&#8217;s some big text in the middle saying&nbsp;&#8220;Jane Austen couldn&#8217;t have won MotoGP. &nbsp;But maybe soon a woman will come&nbsp;along who can compete at the top.&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;m quite a fan of Jane Austen and&nbsp;hate to see her put down like that. &nbsp;Also, I am intrigued, because&nbsp;everything about bikes that I didn&#8217;t already learn from <i>Zen</i> and the&nbsp;art of same I learned from my wife.<br /><br />Turns out the guy has a claim, that women bikers are fundamentally&nbsp;different to men bikers. &nbsp;He has a lot of stories to back it up, too.&nbsp;Like when he was a kid, other kids said &#8220;chicks dig bikes&#8221; but actually&nbsp;they—the chicks, not the kids—dug cars instead. &nbsp;Or how he asked&nbsp;his wife if she&#8217;d still ride when he died and she said no, it would be&nbsp;too much fuss. &nbsp;Or how some woman win some bike competitions sometimes.&nbsp;Cool stories, no?<br /><br />He goes on to quote his wife saying that women aren&#8217;t evolved to respond&nbsp;to stress with increased vigilance and a readiness to fight, the way&nbsp;that men are. &nbsp;Which kind of clinches it really.<br /><br />The poor guy has to fill a page with text once a month—I feel for&nbsp;him, I really do. &nbsp;I still can&#8217;t help but wish that he&#8217;d have given a&nbsp;local boffin a ring or something. &nbsp;It&#8217;s never going to be Pulitzer&nbsp;material, but at least you could make it look like you&#8217;ve put some&nbsp;effort in. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a rare day that a bit of a think and a quick chat with&nbsp;your spouse is going to challenge your fundamental assumptions about&nbsp;anything, so if you&#8217;re going to write about gender equality as<br />pertaining to competitive motorcycle racing you might as well do a quick&nbsp;search on Wikipedia. &nbsp;You might learn something.<br /><br />Still, it&#8217;s the nature of the genre, isn&#8217;t it? &nbsp;You&#8217;re never going to&nbsp;get cutting edge scientific journalism in the pages of <i>Bike</i>, and even&nbsp;if you did it would still be glued together with warm stories of human&nbsp;interest, as per the standard formula.<br /><br />And then I found a fiver.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: Bargain.</div>

Keen readers of Echo &amp; Bounce will notice two things about the last two posts:<br /><br /><ol><li>they were unusually close together</li><li>neither were about books I&#8217;ve just read</li></ol><div>Although, to be fair, I mention books in one of them.</div><div><br /></div><div>As documented previously, I&#8217;m participating in the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>. The first word, picked in an all-too-frequent attack of stupidity by yours truly, was &#8220;ambition&#8221;. My take, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/ambition.html">previously</a>, and <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice&#8217;s take on his blog</a>. My next word will not be so high falutin.</div><div><br /></div><div>The word for next week, picked by Bice, is &#8220;anecdote&#8221;. I looked it up, and it doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;a cure for poison&#8221;, so I&#8217;m out of ideas.</div><div><br /></div><div>As Bice <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/2013/01/the-year-of-writing-dangerously.html">mentions</a>, there&#8217;s no great way to follow both his posts and mine at this stage: no doubt we&#8217;ll over-engineer a solution some time after the year is out. In the mean time, you probably want to follow him. We&#8217;ll both try to label our posts with alphabet-supremacy, so you can spot the relevant ones.</div></div>

		<h1><a href="/2013/01/06/ambition.html">Ambition</a></h1>
		<time>06 January 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<div class='post'>
I think about ambition every now and then. &nbsp;It&#8217;s an important thing in my&nbsp;life and something I dearly wish I could better understand. &nbsp;When I think&nbsp;about it, two people come to mind. Both are fictional, and both are drunks.<br /><br />The first is from <i>Macbeth</i>.&nbsp;When we were studying it, we eventually got to Act 2, Scene 3, where&nbsp;Porter shows up to provide some comic relief for the groundlings.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, &nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />That you do lie so late?<br /><br />Porter&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span><br />&#8216;Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock: and drink,  <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />sir, is a great provoker of three things.<br /><br />MACDUFF<br />What three things does drink especially provoke?<br /><br />PORTER &nbsp; <br />Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.<br />Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes<br />the desire, but it takes away the performance: there-<br />fore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator<br />with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets&nbsp;him<br />on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and dis-<br />heartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in<br />conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the<br />lie, leaves him.<br /><br /><br />I don&#8217;t have many memories of distinct episodes from high school. &nbsp;I can&nbsp;remember the people, and what I learnt, and practically every embarrassing&nbsp;thing I said or did. &nbsp;This hits all three.<br /><br /><br />Our teacher, Mrs Keates, told us (in a fashion I have since learned is common&nbsp;to English teachers everywhere) that this wasn&#8217;t merely bad comedy but that it&nbsp;had a Deeper Significance. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i>, as it turns out, is a play largely&nbsp;about ambition, perhaps best highlighted in Macbeth&#8217;s claim that he has &#8220;no spur to prick the sides of [his] intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o&#8217;erleaps itself and falls on th&#8217;other&#8221;.<br /><br />And just as a rider who too eagerly tries to mount a horse and falls on the&nbsp;other side, or as a man incited to lasciviousness by too much liquor, the&nbsp;attempt to succeed is doomed to fail.<br /><br />I was a lot younger than the others in my English class, and knew little of&nbsp;lechery or drink. &nbsp;I did know something of ambition however. &nbsp;I wanted to get&nbsp;out of small, dry, dusty Kingaroy, to see the world and to learn everything&nbsp;that it was possible to learn.<br /><br />Because I didn&#8217;t understand the porter&#8217;s joke, and because I wanted to learn,&nbsp;I stayed after class to ask Mrs Keates what she was getting at. &nbsp;She&nbsp;explained, and did a fantastic job of masking her amusement. &nbsp;To this day, I&nbsp;can&#8217;t remember what she said, but I walked away embarrassed and knowing a bit&nbsp;more about lechery and drink than I&#8217;d be able to benefit from for some years.<br /><br />I still don&#8217;t know what to think about <i>Macbeth</i>&#8217;s condemnation of ambition,&nbsp;as being entirely free of it doesn&#8217;t work either. &nbsp;The other fictitious drunk&nbsp;that I was reminded of is Sydney Carton, from <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>. &nbsp;His&nbsp;defining trait is his lack of ambition. &nbsp;He wastes away his talents while his&nbsp;boss, Stryver (!), benefits from them. &nbsp;So much so that there&#8217;s a sense in&nbsp;which his famous last words aren&#8217;t saying much. &nbsp;Giving his life for Charles&nbsp;Darnay must be a far better thing than he has done, because it&#8217;s the <i>only&nbsp;</i>thing he has done.<br /><br />I do not want to end with luke-warm Dumbledorizing that too much is&nbsp;bad, and too little bad also. &nbsp;Perhaps ambition is dignified or diminished by&nbsp;its object? &nbsp;There&#8217;s something in this. &nbsp;<i>Macbeth</i> shows that any gains you&nbsp;make by striving for the sake of yourself are ultimately hollow. &nbsp;The apostles&nbsp;also frequently warn against &#8220;selfish ambition&#8221;.<br /><br />But to leave it there isn&#8217;t enough. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just the aim of the ambition but&nbsp;the force behind it. &nbsp;Shakespeare also catches on the unruliness of the&nbsp;desire, the way it governs you rather than you it, and leaves you at its&nbsp;mercy.<br /><br />In this, Macbeth and Sydney Carton have something in common, as Carton&#8217;s crush&nbsp;on Lucie Manette has the same self-defeating properties as Macbeth&#8217;s ambition.&nbsp;He&#8217;s consumed by it and rendered powerless by it. &nbsp;Boyish Crush is the lanky&nbsp;nephew of Drunken Lechery.<br /><br />All of which perhaps explain what makes some ambition bad, but doesn&#8217;t say&nbsp;much about what makes it good. &nbsp;What is it that we admire about the ambition&nbsp;we see in others? &nbsp;In ourselves? &nbsp;How do we prevent our own noble ambitions –&nbsp;if there truly is such a thing – from losing their way and perhaps causing us&nbsp;to lose ours? &nbsp;A lack of time and a lack of insight conspire to prevent me&nbsp;from answering.<br /><br />Shortly after I finished high school, my family left Kingaroy for Tasmania,&nbsp;and in the years since I&#8217;ve seen much of the world. &nbsp;I still don&#8217;t know&nbsp;everything, but it&#8217;s something to aim for, right?<br /><div><br /></div></div>

<br />I finished up 2012 with a vague intention to write more in 2013. &nbsp;I asked folk&nbsp;on G+ what I could do to turn this vague intention into a more solid reality,&nbsp;and they <a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts/Hi76pkq9C8p">did</a><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts/Hi76pkq9C8p">did not disappoint</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://mary.gardiner.id.au/">Mary Gardiner</a> made some great suggestions, starting with:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The usual: make a public commitment, make a shared commitment, make it a<br />competition, somehow organise it so that your writing is a commitment to<br />another person rather than to yourself.</blockquote>I think these are excellent ideas, so I got in touch with my friend&nbsp;<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>&nbsp;and asked him if we wanted to be my&nbsp;writing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frenemesis&amp;defid=5343186">frenemesis</a>&nbsp;for 2013.<br /><br />He agreed, with his usual aplomb, came back with an idea on how to make it a&nbsp;public and shared commitment, and also a bit of a competition.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to work:<br /><br /><ul><li>Week 1, jml picks a word starting with &#8216;A&#8217;, we both write something</li><li>Week 2, Bice picks an &#8216;A&#8217;, we both write something</li><li>Repeat 24 more times, skipping &#8216;X&#8217; because no one likes xylophones&nbsp;and because we want Christmas off</li><li>Words aren&#8217;t restricted to a particular field – anything goes. It must, however, be a single word</li><li>Deadline for posting is 00:00 Monday UTC, the post must also specify the word for next week if it&#8217;s your turn for it</li><li>Aiming for around 600 words per post</li><li>Each week we put £5 into a pot, if either doesn&#8217;t publish a post or pick a new word by the&nbsp;deadline, he forfeits the pot to the other</li><li>Whether a post is on topic is judged by general acclamation, and is largely left up to our own consciences</li></ul>I was secretly hoping that this thing with Bice would resolve all of the conflicting awfulness I feel about my current blogging setup, but it was not to be.&nbsp;For the time being, the blog posts will appear on our respective blogs.<br /><br />The first post is due in less than thirty-six hours.&nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty excited about it.<br /><br />Also, Mary has written up her excellent suggestions on&nbsp;<a href="http://lecta.puzzling.org/2013/01/01/how-to-do-more-writing-by-someone-who-has-never-made-any-such-resolution/">how do to more writing</a>, and I would urge you to read them if you have a similar resolution.<br /><br /></div>

<br />(Skip to the bottom for a tl;dr summary)<br /><br />I read a lot. &nbsp;Reading has always been one of the chief pleasures in my life,&nbsp;and anyone who has spent more than a half hour with me knows that I also rather enjoy talking about what I read.<br /><br />In 2012, inspired by my friends Benny Walter &amp; Jean-Paul Calderone, and my old mentor&nbsp;Martin Chance, I&#8217;ve tried to keep a reading journal. I&#8217;ve kept this journal by&nbsp;inflicting the books I&#8217;ve read on the readers of this blog. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve gone through my posts on this blog, and some other notes about books I haven&#8217;t blogged here, and it turns out that I read sixty-five books in 2012. That is an awful lot of reading, and I think deserves a summary post.<br /><br />What I&#8217;d like to&nbsp;do now is recommend one fiction and one non-fiction book that I&#8217;ve read last&nbsp;year, and call out a few trends in my reading.<br /><h2>Top fiction</h2>I&#8217;ve read so much last year, and if I can take anything away it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s&nbsp;<i>so much</i> that can be done with the written word. &nbsp;My most recent reads,&nbsp;<i>Rivers of London</i>&nbsp;(Ben Aaronovitch) and <i>Invisible Cities</i>&nbsp;(Italo Calvino),&nbsp;brought this home to me. &nbsp;The former is a competently written, fun urban&nbsp;fantasy / police procedural set in London, the second a series of meditations&nbsp;on imagined cities. &nbsp;They are nothing alike, except that they are written and<br />made-up and brought me delight.<br /><br />This makes picking one thing basically impossible. &nbsp;After all, some books go better with&nbsp;some moods. &nbsp;<i>Redshirts</i> (John Scalzi) requires little brain to enjoy, despite&nbsp;being an intelligent book. &nbsp;<i>Peace</i>&nbsp;(Gene Wolfe) on the other hand, is&nbsp;actively out to get you. &nbsp;I found <i>Silas Marner</i>&nbsp;(George Eliot) morally and spiritually&nbsp;challenging, while <i>Gaudy Night</i>&nbsp; (Dorothy Sayers)&nbsp;gave me a few warm, comfortable moments of pretending to&nbsp;have had the Oxford education I always wanted. <br /><br />But, I want to&nbsp;pick just one book. &nbsp;At this point, it&#8217;s a matter of both pride and&nbsp;practicality. &nbsp;I really will go on forever if I don&#8217;t pick something.<br /><br />Ready? Good. &nbsp;Here it is: <i>Gawain and The Green Knight, </i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage.<br /><br /><i>Gawain</i>&nbsp;is an old English poem by an anonymous author. Armitage&#8217;s translation keeps to the&nbsp;alliterative structure of Saxon verse, but uses modern English. &nbsp;Although I&#8217;d&nbsp;read another translation of the poem before, I had never really &#8220;got it&#8221;.&nbsp;Attempts to make great works more accessible can often end with the many&nbsp;excellences of the original being lost. Armitage does just the opposite: he&nbsp;opened <i>Gawain</i> up to me and helped me see what all the fuss is about. &nbsp;Also,&nbsp;it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure to read aloud, has a fun story, and is short. &nbsp;What&nbsp;more could you possibly want?<br /><br />Close runners up include <i>David Copperfield</i> (I figured you&#8217;d already heard of&nbsp;it), <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>&nbsp;(great, but a little too much the kind of book&nbsp;that you read in high school English classes for me to recommend it as <i>the</i>&nbsp;book), <i>The Graveyard Book</i>&nbsp;(perfect, but a children&#8217;s book), and <i>The Fifth&nbsp;Head of Cerberus</i>&nbsp;(disqualified because it&#8217;s a re-read, and because I&#8217;ve&nbsp;yammered enough about Gene Wolfe).<br /><h2>Top non-fiction</h2>In contrast to picking my top novel, this one is easy. &nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel is short, well-written, and on a matter of interest to&nbsp;anyone reading this blog: how the things in our society are changed by being&nbsp;traded in markets.<br /><br />Reading the book challenged my generally positive attitude to free market capitalism and has left me with a more nuanced view. Also, in his carefully&nbsp;defined notion of &#8220;corruption&#8221;, Sandel has given me a new tool for thinking&nbsp;about all sorts of things.<br /><br />Close runners-up include <i>Debt</i>&nbsp;by David Graeber (fascinating explosion ideas&nbsp;that suffer from lack of organization) and <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>&nbsp;by Daniel&nbsp;Kahneman, which would have won, save that the ideas in <i>Thinking</i>&nbsp;were more&nbsp;familiar to me than the ideas in <i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>.<br /><h2>Trends</h2><h3>Kanban</h3>This year I&#8217;ve been applying kanban techniques to my reading. &nbsp;In a nutshell,&nbsp;I limit the number of books I read at once (max 4), and have a very limited&nbsp;selection of books selected to read next (max 9). &nbsp;The &#8220;In Progress&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;Next&#8221; books are very visible.<br /><br />It means I&#8217;m always finishing books, which is a nice feeling. &nbsp;It also means&nbsp;fewer books on the go at once, which in turn means that I can focus better on&nbsp;the books I&#8217;m reading, and feel less guilty about the books I&#8217;m not reading.<br /><br />It also means that when I get a recommendation, I don&#8217;t have to put it at the&nbsp;bottom of a pile, but can make a decision and actually stand a chance of&nbsp;reading it in the next six months.<br /><br />This is very much a nerdy thing to do, but that&#8217;s how I roll.<br /><br /><b>Books with exercises</b><br /><br />I&#8217;ve tried to do more study this year, especially on things that will help my&nbsp;professional development. &nbsp;This has meant reading books that have exercises. They have been&nbsp;rewarding, but they take <i>ages</i>&nbsp;to get through. &nbsp;The kanban system makes&nbsp;it really obvious.<br /><br />Further, I often need to read them at a computer, in a certain state of mind&nbsp;and with a high chance of not being interrupted for an hour or so. &nbsp;That&#8217;s&nbsp;pretty rare.<br /><br /><b>Short stories</b><br /><br />Back when I primarily read paperbacks, I would only very rarely go to a book&nbsp;store and by an anthology of short stories. &nbsp;Now that I use an eBook reader, I&nbsp;read many, many more short stories than I used to.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t expect that, although perhaps I should have. &nbsp;Since I always carry&nbsp;around an ebook reader around, I have much more choice about what to read. &nbsp;I&nbsp;also keep at least one collection of short stories on my phone, in case I&#8217;m&nbsp;stuck without my Kindle.<br /><br />This means that there are plenty more <i>opportunities</i> to read short stories,&nbsp;which seems to mean I read more. &nbsp;This in turn means I get to discover new&nbsp;authors.<br /><h3>Blogging and logging</h3>I&#8217;m not very satisfied with dumping lists of books on my blog. &nbsp;I&#8217;m also&nbsp;unhappy with the reviews I&#8217;ve written, which so rarely do justice to my own&nbsp;opinions and feelings, let alone the books themselves.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to be able to log when I start reading a book, when I finish it, and&nbsp;whether I actually finished it or just gave up. &nbsp;I&#8217;d like to be able to look&nbsp;over books I&#8217;ve read recently and see what genres I&#8217;ve been reading from. &nbsp;I&#8217;d&nbsp;like to do this on something that&#8217;s not a social website. &nbsp;(Do you think I&nbsp;read to be social?)<br /><h2>Overall</h2>I&#8217;m blessed to be able to read and enjoy so many books. &nbsp;As I said earlier, 65&nbsp;books is a lot, and I can&#8217;t help but wonder at what I could have done if I had&nbsp;only read thirty books.<br /><h2>tl;dr</h2><div><br /><ul><li>I read 65+ books in 2012</li><li>Top fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>Gawain and The Green Knight,&nbsp;</i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage</li><li>Top non-fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel</li></ul></div></div>
