My organizational system lacked vitality last year. It was rarely consulted, tedious to look at and on the whole not very fun. Now that I&#8217;m somewhat back on top of things, I think I&#8217;ve identified the fundamental thing that I missed, the thing I needed to breathe life into the system, much like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Matrix">Creation Matrix</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collect</span><br />Every time you think of something to do, something you&#8217;re unsure about or something overflowing with bodacity, <span style="font-style: italic;">write it down</span>. It&#8217;s important to have a very small number of places where these written notes go, but it&#8217;s more important to make the notes in the first place.<br /><br />I carry around a small spiral notebook and write in that. When I&#8217;m at my desk, I write on index cards, or in an emacs buffer called &#8216;inbox&#8217;.<br /><br />Without this, I kept forgetting stuff, felt busier than I was and made poor decisions about what to do with my free time. I also missed lots of opportunities. Carrying around a little notebook has actually made me feel better.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>

So basically you&#8217;ve just realised where girls are coming from with heavy bags, and that we had it right all along? that actually maybe there is a point to having keys, purse, phone, notebook, reading book/mag, panadol and a hanky on you at all times :)</div>

My &#8220;anywhere&#8221;, &#8220;errands&#8221; and &#8220;phone&#8221; contexts are on my laptop, as well as my &#8220;someday/maybe&#8221; lists. That means if I don&#8217;t have my laptop with me, I can&#8217;t easily churn through my list of phone calls to make. If I do have my laptop with me, which is more likely, it&#8217;s still a pain to pull it out, open it up and type in my password just to remind myself of whether I need to buy more Vegemite.<br /><br />Possible solutions: paper-based system (yuck!) or some sort of portable electronic device.</div>

What Steve said. <BR/>I like the idea of the swish iPAQs, they&#8217;re, well, not macs, so when they break you stand a decent chance of prompt and effective support, they run windows mobile nicely (mostly), and i&#8217;ll bet if you threw enough effort at it they&#8217;d probably do linux.<BR/>Aidan keeps saying how cool eee pcs are. Only as far as I can see they have the inconvenience of being too big to hold in one hand easily combined with the inconvenience of small keys. In lieu of a proper laptop I&#8217;d go a nice palm top phone.<BR/><BR/>Failing that, I think the iPod Touch probably is a good answer, this just comes back to my problem with Apple service and support. In fact for me it&#8217;d be tight between that and paper, and I think paper would probably win, at least you can doodle on paper :)</div>

Such organisation is the #1 reason I bought a (shudder) windows mobile a bit over a year ago.<BR/>Despite all the (very many) faults, just having a device that goes *everywhere* with me that pops up reminders (usually - see faults) and is pretty easy to get info into is a godsend.<BR/>The book &#8220;Time Management for Sysadmins&#8221; has some really good stuff on this. Is obvious why I&#8217;d have read that book. :-)</div>

I have often had the same thought: the problem then being that I have absolutely no inclination to start paying some phone provider the hundreds of extra dollars per year they&#8217;d want over my current phone contract. (I spend about $25/month.)<BR/><BR/>I am waiting for time to provide an economic answer on this one.</div>

I&#8217;m back in Sydney and well and truly into a working mindset. I might talk about some of the stuff that happened over the holidays, but first I have a bug to report in my own organizational system.<br /><br />At the moment, all of my projects and next actions live together, I make no distinction between work actions and non-work actions. I&#8217;m starting to find this a pain, because it means that when I&#8217;m &#8220;at work&#8221; there are all of these next actions on my lists that I can&#8217;t do in good conscience, which slows down decision making as I mentally filter the list.<br /><br />I also wonder whether working from home makes this bug more of a pain.<br /><br />The fix might be as simple as adding a &#8220;work&#8221; context to my system. I&#8217;d love to know what you think.</div>

Yeah, splitting it might help. It&#8217;s fine to have access to work AND non-work while at home/in your own time, but at work, you need to only do work (haha, says she reading your blog :p - it&#8217;s my birthday, and I&#8217;ll read blogs if I want to!). So making the physical distinction might help, rather than you having to mentally filter and rank (although, of course, sometimes there are things you DO need to do at work because, for instance, you can only go to the bank in business hours).<BR/><BR/>I tend to agree. Working from home seems great, and works occasionally, but I think having the office and forcing yourself to go there most days removes the &#8216;which task do I do now&#8217; dilemma predominantly - though of course it&#8217;s nice to be able to stay home where you&#8217;re comfortable and there&#8217;s no one to distract you with meetings etc.<BR/><BR/>I dunno. I go to uni every day and do&#8230;. stuff. Only then I just feel unjustified because I&#8217;m not making a lot of research progress and I get paid a pittance, I feel like for what I get paid and what I achieve for msyelf, I should totally be having 3 days a week at home to relax! But no, then I&#8217;d not get anything done. Meh. Life!</div>

&#8230; which means, a logical sounding explanation for doing something that you would do anyway. Or a phrase.<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, I always buy the yellow ones,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re better at catching flies.&#8221; But actually, he buys them because that&#8217;s what his mum always bought when he was a kid.</div>

Question isn&#8217;t clear.  Do you mean a logical sounding explanation for something you would do anyway, but is actually just a habit?  <BR/><BR/>Or just a logical sounding explanation for something you do regularly?</div>

I&#8217;ve just done something that&#8217;s rare for me: I&#8217;ve read two non-fiction books in a row.<br /><br />The first is <span style="font-style: italic;">The Reason for God</span>, by Tim Keller. This is a very good book that opens with a quote from Darth Vader and then quickly settles into calm reason that actually <span style="font-style: italic;">listens</span> to both sides of the argument. This quote from the book is a great summary of something I believe very strongly:<br /><blockquote>Believers should acknowledge and wrestle with doubts&#8211;not only their own but their friends&#8217; and neighbors&#8217;. [&#8230;] Only if you struggle long and hard with objections to your faith will you be able to provide grounds for your beliefs to skeptics, including yourself, that are plausible rather than ridiculous or offensive. And, [&#8230;] such a process will lead you, even after you come to a position of strong faith, to respect and understand those who doubt.<br /></blockquote>If you want to get a good idea of my approach to questions of faith, religion and what not without me boring you to tears about it, then find some way to read the introduction to this book.<br /><br />I have some criticisms of the book, which I&#8217;ll save up for another post. For now, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s very good. If you are going to read <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> book about Christianity in 2009, this should probably be it.<br /><br />The other book is <span style="font-style: italic;">Managing Humans</span>, by Michael Lopp. It&#8217;s a bunch of essays about being a manager in Silicon Valley. Some of the essays skated quite close to the bleedingly obvious (particularly the meeting ones), but are helpful since they remind you to get some perspective. Others aren&#8217;t relevant to me, since I&#8217;m no-one&#8217;s manager or because I don&#8217;t live in the Valley. Still, I think I&#8217;ll want to read through it again in a couple of years time for that perspective and to be re-told the core message: the people are the business, and they are humans like me.</div>

The first sounds like a book I&#8217;d like to read. I&#8217;ve looked it up, but am not much interested in buying on Amazon just now, and typically it&#8217;s not in the nearest library. I will read it one day though.<BR/>Thanks for bringing it to my attention :)<BR/><BR/>Also, today&#8217;s magic word is &#8220;feckab&#8221;. Ugh!?</div>

I was toying around with an idea for a short fantasy-genre story called &#8220;A guy with a sword&#8221; last night and thinking about how (if at all) it should be influenced by my own Australian nature.<br /><br />But then I was thinking, have swords ever been a big deal here?

As far as I know swords were common in the gentry way-back-when, but for little more than ornamental purposes.<BR/><BR/>It was common for certain military ranks to wear swords as part of formal dress, but certainly not for combat.</div>

I&#8217;ve had a cold this week and I&#8217;m getting the cough I get after I get colds of this kind. My right arm feels like it has been twisted backwards in my right arm socket. The days are getting warmer and muggier and the nights aren&#8217;t cold enough to let me sleep.<br /><br />But that&#8217;s all ripples on the surface. Beneath the churn is an ocean that&#8217;s unaffected. I&#8217;d say a calm ocean, but that would be lying. If we had to stretch the metaphor further (and I feel we must), then I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s at least some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> going on down there.<br /><br />Reflecting on a year in Sydney, I realize that the words spoken by all my friends last year were true. It is a big place that&#8217;s hard to get around. It is difficult to make friends here, even in church. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what this means for next year.<br /><br />In other news, I&#8217;ve finished reading <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>. I like it a lot, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that it&#8217;s a shallower knock-off of <i>Infinite Jest</i>, even if it was published twenty years before it.</div>
