I applied to iiNet for my Naked DSL line on July the 7th. I still don&#8217;t have Internet access at home. I won&#8217;t have it, they say, until next week or the week after.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll be in Hobart for two weeks from Wednesday afternoon, so I will have waited <span style="font-style:italic;">two months</span> for an Internet connection at my house. That&#8217;s assuming nothing goes wrong.</div>

Yep. The awesomeness of iiNet&#8217;s product is inversely proportional to their level of service.</div>

Dear Lazyweb,<br /><br />Does anyone know of cafés on the North Shore of Sydney that provide free / cheap Internet and don&#8217;t mind it if someone sits by themselves quietly spending money all day? The closer to Lindfield the better.<br /><br />jml</div>

Palmerston North is a strange town. There are three things that single it out from other towns, which I shall enumerate as follows:<br /><br />  1. No one between the age of 25 and 60 has a New Zealand accent.<br />  2. The public library is the coolest place in town.<br />  3. It is ruled entirely by ducks.<br /><br />More later.</div>

I&#8217;ve been without Internet in my home for six and one half days. To do my job, I have been commuting to Andrew and Mary&#8217;s where I am graciously lavished with the Internet&#8217;s bounty. Today, however was supposed to be different.<br /><br />Telstra was scheduled to connect my line at some time between 8am and 1pm. The exact time being known only to the technician and to God.<br /><br />The technician called me at around 9am saying that he had connected the line at the exchange and was just confirming that. At around twenty to twelve, he called me, confirming my building was indeed number 250 that&#8217;s two-five-zero. Then he hung up.<br /><br />He called me again. You see, we both need to be sure that the building I live in is indeed two hundred and fifty that&#8217;s two-five-zero, the one next to the service station. We assured each other of our certainty, then he hung up. I started worrying. I had expected a certain level of confusion—Telstra have a reputation to maintain—but this seemed excessive.<br /><br />My phone rang again. Apparently the technician and I are both victims of a cruel deception. &#8220;They&#8221; told him that he was supposed to connect me on the building on the other side of the road. &#8220;They&#8221; gave him the wrong details, although apparently the correct address. He sees now that the place where I should be connected to is right next to my building.<br /><br />He&#8217;s sending the job back to them. They will sort it out. They will probably call me tomorrow or the next day and send him out again, he says. They will explain what&#8217;s going on. No, my line hasn&#8217;t been connected today.<br /><br />Goodbye.</div>

What&#8217;s that word, the one for when people unite to achieve a single goal and spend effort, time, energy, creativity, nous, emotion, money, business cunning and sweat on some grand endeavour?<br /><br />The closest I&#8217;ve got is &#8220;industry&#8221;. It&#8217;s a shame the word doesn&#8217;t carry a sense of wonder and verve with it.</div>

I was thinking enterprise too.  Why not endeavour, or venture?  (Star) ship names are good.<BR/><BR/>The only thing I can think of that covers all those qualities is the building of the pyramids, how about pyramidise?</div>

enterprise comes from the French meaning something like &#8216;undertaking&#8217;.<BR/><BR/>perhaps this is helpful?</div>

Enterprise is close. The word is used and mocked a lot in IT circles, because it&#8217;s generally code for &#8220;big, bloated and slow&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Mission is OK, but doesn&#8217;t have the grit I want.<BR/><BR/>Maybe I&#8217;m just going to have to actually say what I mean, rather than finding a pre-made word for it.</div>

I had meant to move this weekend just gone. I had arranged the truck, some friends to help and cleared away a space for my possessions in my new home.<br /><br />Sadly, I didn&#8217;t actually <span style="font-style: italic;">pack</span><span>. Like Pope Urban VII, I expected the universe to move around me. I&#8217;m going to try to move again next week. Right now, all of my books, CDs, DVDs and odds-and-ends are all packed. Boxes are scattered on my floor like Biblical allusions in a Nick Cave song.<br /><br />Instead of moving, I revamped <a href="http://mumak.net/">my website</a>, moved <a href="http://code.mumak.net/">my professional blog</a> and set up <a href="http://mumak.net/planet/atom.xml">a feed that aggregates both blogs</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://huwshimi.com/">Huw</a> and <a href="http://puzzling.org/">Mary</a> for their help.<br /><br /></span></div>

I&#8217;d say something about how you should have a moving party and co opt the help of friends, but: don&#8217;t. Just move yourself already. And then have a housewarming.</div>
