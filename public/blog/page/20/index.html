I can imagine a librarian; call him Norris. Norris is sitting on a verandah, drinking an iced tea that&#8217;s just started to sweat in the weekend sun. He&#8217;s reading a book that re-interprets the reign of King Richard III in the light of a vampiric illness, but his eyes just move over the same few lines.<br /><br />Norris is really thinking about how he can make his library a more pleasant place to be, somewhere people like to hang out. Perhaps a potplant or two? Maybe some artwork from local residents? We could even arrange some sort of special with the café downstairs. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.<br /><br />Your problem, dear Norris, is that your library is built to house books. Everything about it is there to keep them organized, contained and available. It&#8217;s a warehouse—nothing more. Adding a pot-plant will make it a warehouse with a pot-plant. In this way, books are worse than boxes. Books have a force of their own. Too many together in one space can become oppressive. Being in such a place is like standing at the edge of a great cliff, or sharing a cage with a tiger: awe-inspiring, exhilarating, terrifying; never comfortable. Face it Norris, it&#8217;s too late for you and your library.<br /><br />In another place, a place where the ducks rule and the traffic lights whistle, in a university town without a university, in a village where the square at night is home to racer boys and a fluorescent cross of many colours, there is a Library.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to say what makes this Library different. Other libraries feel like temples, or crypts; this one feels like a big lounge room. There&#8217;s not the buzz of an urban café, but there&#8217;s not the usual solemn quiet either. From the main floor you can <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> the CD and film area downstairs. Around the corner from the non-fiction area there&#8217;s a public phone. The walls have reds and blues and yellows. On the north side there reading chairs next to large windows that look onto the town square and the town&#8217;s duck lords.  While I was there a boy played the piano part of Bohemian Rhapsody from memory. Anyone could easily spend a whole day here and reckon it pleasant one.<br /><br />Obviously it was intended to be this way from the beginning. The comfort of the Library is partly because it is whole, not a few token efforts scraped together. The planners must have asked themselves &#8220;How can we make this a pleasant place to be&#8221; over and over. They had a core value by which all decisions could be measured. They have sacrificed some virtues—there are many fewer books than the space permits—in order to excel in this hospitality.<br /><br />Perhaps poor Norris can take comfort in this. His library may never quite be the <span style="font-style: italic;">place </span>that Palmerston North Library is, but it can certainly have <span style="font-style: italic;">more books</span>. After all, what&#8217;s a library for?</div>

Awesome.<BR/><BR/>Have you ever tried the Customs House Library? It&#8217;s at circular quay, but don&#8217;t hold that against it.<BR/><BR/>A girl whose blog I read often goes there for &#8216;writing days&#8217;. Here&#8217;s a post about how cool it is:<BR/><BR/>http://hippocampusextensions.com/karen/archives/2008/04/<BR/><BR/>(scroll down quite a bit, it&#8217;s the 4th or 5th one down the page - I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to save it by itself)</div>

I have <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">never</span></span> withdrawn my application.<br /><br />Is the incompetence or is it actually part of some malevolent plan?

I applied to iiNet for my Naked DSL line on July the 7th. I still don&#8217;t have Internet access at home. I won&#8217;t have it, they say, until next week or the week after.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll be in Hobart for two weeks from Wednesday afternoon, so I will have waited <span style="font-style:italic;">two months</span> for an Internet connection at my house. That&#8217;s assuming nothing goes wrong.</div>

Palmerston North is a strange town. There are three things that single it out from other towns, which I shall enumerate as follows:<br /><br />  1. No one between the age of 25 and 60 has a New Zealand accent.<br />  2. The public library is the coolest place in town.<br />  3. It is ruled entirely by ducks.<br /><br />More later.</div>

I&#8217;ve been without Internet in my home for six and one half days. To do my job, I have been commuting to Andrew and Mary&#8217;s where I am graciously lavished with the Internet&#8217;s bounty. Today, however was supposed to be different.<br /><br />Telstra was scheduled to connect my line at some time between 8am and 1pm. The exact time being known only to the technician and to God.<br /><br />The technician called me at around 9am saying that he had connected the line at the exchange and was just confirming that. At around twenty to twelve, he called me, confirming my building was indeed number 250 that&#8217;s two-five-zero. Then he hung up.<br /><br />He called me again. You see, we both need to be sure that the building I live in is indeed two hundred and fifty that&#8217;s two-five-zero, the one next to the service station. We assured each other of our certainty, then he hung up. I started worrying. I had expected a certain level of confusion—Telstra have a reputation to maintain—but this seemed excessive.<br /><br />My phone rang again. Apparently the technician and I are both victims of a cruel deception. &#8220;They&#8221; told him that he was supposed to connect me on the building on the other side of the road. &#8220;They&#8221; gave him the wrong details, although apparently the correct address. He sees now that the place where I should be connected to is right next to my building.<br /><br />He&#8217;s sending the job back to them. They will sort it out. They will probably call me tomorrow or the next day and send him out again, he says. They will explain what&#8217;s going on. No, my line hasn&#8217;t been connected today.<br /><br />Goodbye.</div>

What&#8217;s that word, the one for when people unite to achieve a single goal and spend effort, time, energy, creativity, nous, emotion, money, business cunning and sweat on some grand endeavour?<br /><br />The closest I&#8217;ve got is &#8220;industry&#8221;.

I was thinking enterprise too.  Why not endeavour, or venture?  (Star) ship names are good.<BR/><BR/>The only thing I can think of that covers all those qualities is the building of the pyramids, how about pyramidise?</div>

enterprise comes from the French meaning something like &#8216;undertaking&#8217;.<BR/><BR/>perhaps this is helpful?</div>

Enterprise is close. The word is used and mocked a lot in IT circles, because it&#8217;s generally code for &#8220;big, bloated and slow&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Mission is OK, but doesn&#8217;t have the grit I want.<BR/><BR/>Maybe I&#8217;m just going to have to actually say what I mean, rather than finding a pre-made word for it.</div>
