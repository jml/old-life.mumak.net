I&#8217;ve just made some custard from scratch. The flavour is a lot better than my previous attempt, which had way too much vanilla and sugar. Sadly, I overcooked this batch, which means there&#8217;s lots of little lumps. I could strain them out, but I don&#8217;t have a strainer.<br /><br />Next time!</div>

Copying them to a separate system seems wrong.</li><li>Many, many, many ideas I&#8217;ve had have been pushed back because someone else sets my priorities. I don&#8217;t really know how to best track these—someday/maybes perhaps.</li><li>My set of contexts has shrunk drastically. I&#8217;m basically always at home, on my laptop with an internet connection and phone line able to do work stuff. Breaking stuff up into @home, @work, @online, @computer, @phone doesn&#8217;t make any sense for me.</li><li>I don&#8217;t really feel support from my manager for maintaining the system, even though people appreciate my work &#8220;gardening the bug tracker&#8221;. This makes me reluctant to spend Friday arvo or Monday morning doing a weekly review. This might be imagined.<br /></li><li>Things have been broken so long that I feel I need to have a two day reboot. Scheduling such a thing is hard.</li><li>My collection habit has broken off. This is partly due to having crappy tools: the spiral notebooks irritate me, my pens keep disappearing and I can&#8217;t always carry my moleskine around.</li><li>I&#8217;m not in regular conversation with others who strive for a mind like water. Even the people I&#8217;ve spoken to who understand the system don&#8217;t really seem to value it.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: </span>I get about 150 new email conversations in my inbox every day, and then probably get another 50-60 during the day, excluding spam. Most of these emails are <span style="font-style: italic;">totally irrelevant</span> to me and my life, so I get into this groove of &#8220;Crap; Crap; Crap; Crap; Ooh, interesting; Crap; Crap; Crap etc&#8221; without doing any further processing. It takes ages to get back to actually reviewing the interesting emails and figuring out what I need to do. Then it takes more time to actual do it.<br /></li></ul>I miss the feeling of cleanliness and freedom that I had when I was doing GTD well. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if there are real gaps in the system that I&#8217;ll be able to understand better once I get back into it.<br /><br />In any case, I&#8217;d love to know your thoughts.</div>

Separate desktops would be a pain, and yes, the web 2.0 apps are all terrible in different ways and difficult to evaluate.<BR/><BR/>I think the real benefit of GTD is the way it provides a pattern language for organization: your calendar is not your todo list is not your list of projects etc.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ll be keen to hear how your wiki system evolves.</div>

I only tried GTD for about a week, my major problem was being a user of two separate desktops, necessitating an online or fully synchronised system, and total impatience with signing up for 100 million Web 2.0 sites in order to find a compatible one. (Seriously folks, if I need to do much more than provide my OpenID, at least for an extensive trial, I will not use your web site.) Tomboy didn&#8217;t cut it.<BR/><BR/>But frankly, I&#8217;m so far behind in this headspace. I never even got to the point of being organised with my university lecture notes. I am pretty sure that I did not re-read my notes for any course, ever. I suck at doing this for academic reading too, mostly because&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. I understand writings in a cloud-lie, not sequentially. (This is the reason I have this apparently inexplicable habit of reading almost all books not entirely in page order.) I can do calendars. I can do email. I can usually manage my tasklist in my head even if it does cost in cycles and mood. It&#8217;s proving problematic with my PhD, for which I am moving to a wiki and hoping I can evolve a system of some variety.</div>

For implementing GTD you might try out this web-based application:<BR/><BR/>http://www.Gtdagenda.com<BR/><BR/>You can use it to manage your goals, projects and tasks, set next actions and contexts, use checklists, schedules and a calendar.<BR/>A mobile version and iCal are available too.<BR/><BR/>Hope you like it.</div>

Finished playing Portal last night. Gosh it was fun. I wish the newspaper included a daily Portal puzzle instead of those silly sudoku things. Doubt they could match the script though — those words have power.<br /><br />Listening to <i>Never Mind the Bollocks&#8230;</i> for the second time ever. More music like this please.<br /><br />We mean it, man.</div>

Nevermind the Bollocks&#8230; more overdubs than Dark Side of the Moon.<BR/><BR/>Sounds like: <BR/><BR/>- Stooges three albums (different to Lust for Life)<BR/>- The MC5 (live album)<BR/>- New York Dolls<BR/>- Ramones first few albums<BR/>- First Clash album<BR/>- X-Ray Spex (great girl-fronted group from the same scene)<BR/>- The Undertones, The Damned &amp; The Buzzcocks (get best of&#39;s)<BR/>- The Saints, Radio Birdman and the Birthday Party (all Australian!)<BR/>- Dead Kennedys first few albums<BR/>- X (American - Los Angeles album, and Australian bands)<BR/>- Husker Du<BR/>- Um, the Pixies of course<BR/>- Huggy Bear (cause I love them)<BR/><BR/>&#8230;and a whole heap of 80&#39;s Indie bands leading up to grunge<BR/><BR/>Most of these won&#39;t trouble you with extensive discographies.  Go with The Birthday Party and the Stooges for equal visceral impact (give them some time!)</div>

i would like to play Portal one day.<BR/><BR/>i also would like more music like Never Mind&#8230; but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find it in the Sex Pistols&#39; discography. I like Deri&#39;s suggestion.<BR/><BR/>Little trivia: Malcolm McLaren, the manager, was all into getting the Pistols to play up their S&amp;M image. But Johnny Rotten thought this was a bit lame.<BR/><BR/>Malcolm McLaren tells them to write a song about Submission. So they write a song about a submarine mission :-)</div>

While I was in Hobart, I went to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Brennan">Frank Brennan</a> speak at a regular event called &#8220;Spirituality in the Pub&#8221;. He was given the topic &#8220;Spirituality and Conscience&#8221;, which he interpreted as &#8220;talk about the stuff in your book and interesting things that you&#8217;ve done&#8221;, which was alright with me.<br /><br />I was expecting him to be a better orator. He was certainly clear, and his talk was definitely interesting, but he had a sing-song tone that I found distracting. It&#8217;s a minor thing, of course. I mention it only because I was surprised: I&#8217;ve heard more engaging speakers at Free Software conferences.<br /><br />In his talk, he outlined a few principles and peppered them with anecdotes. First, he said we have to realise that the following are five separate questions that might have five separate answers:<ol><li>What is right for me?</li><li>What is right for those who ask my advice (e.g. my friends, my family, my church)?</li><li>What is the right <i>social policy</i> for a pluralistic democracy?</li><li>What is the right law?</li><li>How should such a law be administered?</li></ol><br /><br />As a conservative Christian who&#8217;s socially liberal, I love this: it&#8217;s a very clear framework for thinking about controversial issues such as abortion, stem-cell research and gay marriage. I personally had never thought about separating the last three points, which seems rather foolish in hindsight. <br /><br />Brennan also emphasised that compromise in politics is perfectly acceptable and logically necessary. After all, what else is politics for? The upshot is that we need to be clear on what our <i>principles</i> are and on the <i>process</i> for compromise.<br /><br />He also mentioned that it&#8217;s important to think about what&#8217;s achievable, and recalled a conversation he had with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ruddock">Philip Ruddock</a> on the mandatory detention centres. Even though Brennan was against mandatory detention, he didn&#8217;t <i>argue</i> against it in that conversation. Instead, he focused on something achievable: regular, independent, public scrutiny of the conditions in those centres.<br /><br />Question time was fun. We had a bit of a chat about what it means to &#8220;acknowledge&#8221; the traditional owners of the land at public gatherings, and I copped a couple of dirty looks from some members of the audience by addressing him as &#8220;Frank&#8221; rather than &#8220;Father&#8221;.<br /><br />On the whole, I wish that he was my local MP. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson">My current one</a> is a little disappointing.</div>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace</span><br />Woah. If you can, get the edition with the foreword by Dave Eggers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lud in the Mist, Hope Mirrlees</span><br />This charming little book lives in the same corner of Faerie as Tolkien&#8217;s and Dunsany&#8217;s works. The Other Realm touches on ours during moments of artistic transcendence, and the aristocracy show up and save us all from the merchant class.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf describes the author as &#8220;a very self conscious, wilful, prickly and perverse young woman, rather conspicuously well dressed and pretty, with a view of her own about books and style, an aristocratic and conservative tendency in opinion and a corresponding taste for the beautiful and elaborate in literature&#8221;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dragon Waiting, John M. Ford</span><br />Roger Zelazny liked this book, but I don&#8217;t. The author plays a fun What If? game with history but then bores us with his characters and plot. Of the four main characters, only one is interesting; another plays Ishmael to Richard of York&#8217;s Ahab and the others are just dreary. Great concept, wasted potential, too many vampires.</div>

This age groans under a surcharge of new books, that, though the many good ones lately published do much to balance the great swarms of ill, or at least needless ones; yet all men complain of the unnecessary charge and trouble many new books put them to: the truth of it is, printing is a trade, and the presses must be kept going[&#8230;]<br /><br />— G Burnet, from the preface to &#8220;The Life of God in the Soul of Man&#8221;, circa 1650.</div>

I&#8217;m officially giving up on <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>. I don&#8217;t like it. It doesn&#8217;t feel solid, the keyboard shortcuts are confusing, the animation bugs me and I can&#8217;t really figure out how to get my &#8216;system&#8217; in there.<br /><br />It&#8217;s really the feeling that gets to me. It somehow feels flaky, unpredictable. I <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> this is partly due to the way it handles item selection. It&#8217;s never really clear what&#8217;s selected and what&#8217;s not. The impression I get is that they are trying to copy Gmail (a worthy goal) and not quite making it.<br /><br />Instead, I&#8217;ll be going back to Emacs (my text editor, kind of like an acid-breathing, gamma-radiated Notepad that has an adamantium skeleton and can walk through walls). It&#8217;s not ideal, but I reckon it will be more effective than RTM. The ideal system would be <span style="font-style: italic;">fun</span> to use, Emacs is merely <span style="font-style: italic;">not painful</span>.<br /><br />Do you have a suggestion for fun Linux task management software?</div>

The problem with web-based stuff is that it&#8217;s only available when I&#8217;m online. My mobile phone is just a mobile phone, so I can&#8217;t really use it for todo management.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m having a look at Toodledo now&#8230;</div>

I&#8217;ve been playing with Thttp://www.toodledo.com/ and it seems to work okay.  Both RTM and Toodledo work with the ToDo on the iphone which is what I wanted.  Although I am also in the Emacs congregation I echo what intellectronica said.  I need my todo list on more than one computer.</div>

Yeah, I&#8217;ve gone off the milk too. Just couldn&#8217;t get over the fact that it wasn&#8217;t integrated with my diary (at the time, google calendar).<BR/><BR/>Nick&#8217;s just bought Omni Focus for his macbook and is loving it.</div>

I still use RTM, although I also find some aspects of the UI annoying (yes, item selection in particular is appalling).<BR/><BR/>The problem with Emacs (or any other desktop software) is that it&#8217;s only available on one computer (or at least on computers from which I can open a terminal connection). After getting used to having access to my todo list from my phone, email, jabber, etc&#8217;&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I can go back.<BR/><BR/>If you find a decent web todo, though, let us know!</div>
