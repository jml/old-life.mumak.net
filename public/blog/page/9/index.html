I like <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>. A lot of her craziness rubs me the wrong way, and I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll ever be into Shiva Nata, but she&#8217;s very much worth listening to.<div><br /></div><div>She recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuff/more-ways-to-use-the-dammit-list/">Dammit List</a> – a bunch of things that you will or will not do, dammit. I like this idea, because I could do a much better job at remembering who I am and what I stand for. Some readers will recall the <a href="http://www.apuritansmind.com/christianwalk/ResolutionsOfJonathanEdwards.htm">Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards</a>, which is only fair.</div><div><br /></div><div>Havi also recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuckification/the-book-of-you/">Book of You</a> – a kind of record of your own patterns and habits that you can use to better understand who you are and how you work, and perhaps even help you to change for the better. It&#8217;s a little bit like informal scientific observation, and a little bit like the advice you&#8217;ll find in <a href="http://www.johnowen.org/">John Owen</a>&#8217;s works, particularly &#8221;<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/owen/mort.html">Of the Mortification of Sin in Believers</a>&#8221;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of a zany Yoga-teaching, Shivanaut pirate, duck-wearing blogger sharing ideas with two heavy-weight, dour, rigorous Puritans. I&#8217;m sure you have better ideas than I do.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I had to say something, it would be that there are not that many good ideas in the world. When you take old wisdom and present it as new, people listen – really listen – in a way that they don&#8217;t when you merely repeat the words of dead wise men. This is why weekly sermons and <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/07/a_kinder_gentle.php">TED talks like Alain de Botton</a>&#8217;s are such good things.</div><div><br /></div></div>

<div>Eleven isn&#8217;t a very big number. Eleven days isn&#8217;t a particularly long time. To be honest, I rarely think about time in chunks of eleven days. Seven days, yes. Thirty days, yes.

I&#8217;ve read so many good books over the last few years. Some of them seem to cry out to be read again.

I like Anna Karenina better too. Better plot and fewer preachy monologues if I recall correctly.</div>

Sadly, I haven&#39;t read any other DeLillo books. I want to read <i>Underworld</i> again partly because I enjoyed it, but mostly because I think there&#39;s depth there that I didn&#39;t fully appreciate the first time.<br /><br />Also, I didn&#39;t mention any Dostoyevsky in that list, because that goes without saying.</div>

I would vote <i>Anna Karenina</i> over <i>War and Peace</i>.  <i>Anna Karenina</i> is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />I&#39;m surprised you liked <i>Underworld</i> so much.  I never could get into that one.  Practically any other DeLillo book is better, IMHO.</div>

And King jml opened his mouth and spoke to the peoples of the land, and he said, &#8220;Lo! There are vendors of chips that are neither salted nor hot, nay, the chips are not even warm. The cooks and merchants who profit from such chips are evil, and ruin marks their way. Therefore I will punish such evildoers and let their own misery fall upon them. Henceforth, all those who sell chips that are cold or chips that are unsalted shall be condemned to eat those chips, yea even at the point of sale.&#8221; And though the vendors of the chips that were cold and the cooks of the chips that were unsalted were afraid, the people of the land rejoiced, for wisdom was found in the heart of the king&#8217;s decree.</div>

A real chip shop should _ask_ if you want salt, unlike this part of the world.  And also not start with frozen chips dammit.<br /><br />Serving them cold is just very very wrong though.</div>

Between that conversation and now, I talked about completely different mental state malfunctions with <a href="http://www.rants.org/">Karl</a>.<div><br /></div><div>It makes me wish there were some rigorous way that we could talk about these states, the problems they cause and the means we have of dealing with them.

A weakness of systems for managing process and attention is that they may eliminate productive distractions.<br /><br />A distraction can also be thought of as a &quot;stepping outside&quot; of the task at hand, and on occasion that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s needed to make real progress, or (especially) to redefine progress.  Of course, one cannot know at the time one steps out side the frame whether that&#39;s going to be a productive move.  I suspect this impossibility of prediction is one of the reasons we seem compelled to distraction even unconsciously &#8211; because our normal decision-making procedures are not suited to deciding when it is time to be distracted, almost by definition.<br /><br />None of which is to say, of course, that all distractions are productive, or that I don&#39;t want more control over mine!  (I want <em>much</em> more control over mine.)  But any general calculus of process is unlikely to take into account the potential value of distractions.<br /><br />A possible analogy might be crime.  We rarely measure the <em>productive</em> value of crime to society, but surely it has some, along with all of crime&#39;s bad effects.  Yes, embezzlement is bad.  On the other hand, what if that mother used embezzled funds to send her daughter to college, whereas the rightful owner of the funds was going to use them to buy another yacht?  Calcluating the cost of the crime overall (as opposed to just the cost to the embezzlee) would require an impossible formula involving the cost of investigation and trust lost, the gain the embezzler&#39;s daughter got from college, the gain to the college, the cost to the yacht-maker (who maybe now can&#39;t afford a good college for <em>his</em> children), the policeman&#39;s salary, the oft-overlooked benefit of keeping society&#39;s crime &quot;immunization&quot; updated (i.e., other crimes are investigated more promptly, or even prevented, because this one was discovered but unsolved), etc.  (Indeed, one could think of property as basically a convention about which costs to consider and which to ignore.)<br /><br />You see what I&#39;m getting at re distractions, I&#39;m sure. :-)</div>

The mind can only do one thing at a time.  People that claim to multi-task are simply task switching very quickly (and usually extremely inefficiently).  I think the problem with Pew Pew! moments and Mouse Distractor Mode is that most of us don&#39;t know how to calm (and thus focus) our minds.<br /><br />Talking about these states is important, names are good because they help us create context, but once we have a clear idea of these states what are we going to do about it?  Recognition is the first stage, so that you know when you&#39;re heading toward Pew Pew! moments, but the next stage is action.  You have to actually change your state if you want the outcome to be different than what you know will already happen.<br /><br />This requires training.  Training to learn what to do and training to change the habits we have that lead to these situations.</div>

<i>The Fatal Shore</i> by Robert Hughes is excellent. Everyone should read it, especially if they are Australian.<div><br /></div><div><div>It&#8217;s a well-written, intelligent history of Australia&#8217;s convict system. It looks into the forces in England that led to the system and the settlement of Australia, it talks about the way Australian society perceived itself, England and the native people of Australia.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Tasmanians will relish the large amount of attention paid to our island.</div><div><br /></div><div>Read it.</div></div>

My mother went through a phase of reading in this line and also recommends Watkin Tench&#39;s diaries. (As primary sources from Sydney, they&#39;re all Sydney-Sydney-Sydney of course.)<br /><br />I like Inga Clendinnen&#39;s &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot; too (also Sydney-Sydney-Sydney).</div>

I&#8217;ve been in London almost six months now, although ten weeks of those six months have been spent overseas.<div><br /></div><div>I love it here. Even though I&#8217;ve not been living the life or seizing every opportunity that comes along, even though I&#8217;ve been working too much and playing too many video games and falling prey to the strange house-bound inertia that beset my ancestors, even with all that, I love this city and feel at home here in a way that I never felt in Sydney.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is a long way from home though. The time difference makes it difficult to talk with family and friends. I wish I could see my niece Tilly more often – she looks so much bigger in every photo. I&#8217;ve also watched a parade of births and birthdays of close friends go past without waving hello or telling them how much I care.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is all a bit maudlin, for which I&#8217;m sorry. Knowing my own faults does not transmute them to virtues, and telling you my faults will not serve as an apology for the hurts they have caused.</div><div><br /></div><div>What can one do but try to change?</div></div>

We&#39;ll be here, whenever you get the chance to visit.<br /><br />Oh, by the way: Layla and Elsa both wanted me to pass on a rasberry, but it&#39;s tough to get the point across in text. <br />Here goes: phththhphphhthhthththh</div>

<div>I&#8217;ve just got back from a seven week stint in Australia and New Zealand. I left two books in Tasmania, but still managed to come back with eight books in my luggage. Books are big and heavy and I&#8217;m sick of carting them around the world watching them get damaged.</div><div><br /></div><div>It&#8217;s time for me to get an electronic book reader. I&#8217;ve resisted for a while because books are not only big and heavy, they are also wonderful and mysterious and almost sacred. Benny once told me that the physical book is the frame for the actual book, much like a bottle is the frame for wine. In both cases, the container has its own beauty, separate from but related to the thing inside that gladdens and warms the heart.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, I cannot abide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> for books.</div><div><br /></div><div>Which electronic book reader should I get? I would love to hear your recommendations. The single essential is that I must be able to load it with non-DRMed books in open formats (PDF, text, HTML).</div></div>

Kindle large-screen is what I&#39;m planning on getting.<br /><br />It can load pdf&#39;s and a couple of the open book formats, and I&#39;m told there should be a software refresh soon to add another.<br /><br />Also the kindle DRM format is broken, so books bought on amazon in that format can be unlocked, backed up and loaded back into the kindle in open form.</div>

I absolutely love my Sony Reader Touch.  I have friends with the Kindle and Nook.  The Kindle&#39;s proprietary format makes things a little difficult to use your own content, and well, DRM is bad, mmkay. The Nook and the Reader both do epub, but the Nook&#39;s battery life doesn&#39;t touch the Readers.  You might have seen me with mine in New Zealand.  I didn&#39;t charge it the entire time I was there and I managed to read three whole books.</div>
