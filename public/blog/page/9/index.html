<a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice</a> just summarized a conversation that he and I had about the <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/2010/04/pew-pews-and-distractor-mice.html">shape of our distractions</a>. Between that conversation and now, I talked about completely different mental state malfunctions with <a href="http://www.rants.org/">Karl</a>.<div><br /></div><div>It makes me wish there were some rigorous way that we could talk about these states, the problems they cause and the means we have of dealing with them. Some kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language">pattern language</a>, or indeed a calculus of action and organization.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once you pare away the tickler files, electric labellers and Californian style, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD">GTD</a> gets close to this. <a href="http://twitter.com/havi">Havi Brooks</a> of <a href="http://www.fluentself.com">The Fluent Self</a> is also doing some great thinking in this area, understanding it as an aspect of Yoga. She came up with the term &#8220;Distractor Mouse Mode&#8221; that Bice wrongly credits me for.</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess you&#8217;ve also got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono">Edward de Bono</a>, the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">life hackers</a>.

A weakness of systems for managing process and attention is that they may eliminate productive distractions.<br /><br />A distraction can also be thought of as a &quot;stepping outside&quot; of the task at hand, and on occasion that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s needed to make real progress, or (especially) to redefine progress.  Of course, one cannot know at the time one steps out side the frame whether that&#39;s going to be a productive move.  I suspect this impossibility of prediction is one of the reasons we seem compelled to distraction even unconsciously &#8211; because our normal decision-making procedures are not suited to deciding when it is time to be distracted, almost by definition.<br /><br />None of which is to say, of course, that all distractions are productive, or that I don&#39;t want more control over mine!  (I want <em>much</em> more control over mine.)  But any general calculus of process is unlikely to take into account the potential value of distractions.<br /><br />A possible analogy might be crime.  We rarely measure the <em>productive</em> value of crime to society, but surely it has some, along with all of crime&#39;s bad effects.  Yes, embezzlement is bad.  On the other hand, what if that mother used embezzled funds to send her daughter to college, whereas the rightful owner of the funds was going to use them to buy another yacht?  Calcluating the cost of the crime overall (as opposed to just the cost to the embezzlee) would require an impossible formula involving the cost of investigation and trust lost, the gain the embezzler&#39;s daughter got from college, the gain to the college, the cost to the yacht-maker (who maybe now can&#39;t afford a good college for <em>his</em> children), the policeman&#39;s salary, the oft-overlooked benefit of keeping society&#39;s crime &quot;immunization&quot; updated (i.e., other crimes are investigated more promptly, or even prevented, because this one was discovered but unsolved), etc.  (Indeed, one could think of property as basically a convention about which costs to consider and which to ignore.)<br /><br />You see what I&#39;m getting at re distractions, I&#39;m sure. :-)</div>

The mind can only do one thing at a time.  People that claim to multi-task are simply task switching very quickly (and usually extremely inefficiently).  I think the problem with Pew Pew! moments and Mouse Distractor Mode is that most of us don&#39;t know how to calm (and thus focus) our minds.<br /><br />Talking about these states is important, names are good because they help us create context, but once we have a clear idea of these states what are we going to do about it?  Recognition is the first stage, so that you know when you&#39;re heading toward Pew Pew! moments, but the next stage is action.  You have to actually change your state if you want the outcome to be different than what you know will already happen.<br /><br />This requires training.  Training to learn what to do and training to change the habits we have that lead to these situations.</div>

My mother went through a phase of reading in this line and also recommends Watkin Tench&#39;s diaries. (As primary sources from Sydney, they&#39;re all Sydney-Sydney-Sydney of course.)<br /><br />I like Inga Clendinnen&#39;s &quot;Dancing with Strangers&quot; too (also Sydney-Sydney-Sydney).</div>

I&#8217;ve been in London almost six months now, although ten weeks of those six months have been spent overseas.<div><br /></div><div>I love it here. Even though I&#8217;ve not been living the life or seizing every opportunity that comes along, even though I&#8217;ve been working too much and playing too many video games and falling prey to the strange house-bound inertia that beset my ancestors, even with all that, I love this city and feel at home here in a way that I never felt in Sydney.</div><div><br /></div><div>It is a long way from home though. The time difference makes it difficult to talk with family and friends. I wish I could see my niece Tilly more often – she looks so much bigger in every photo. I&#8217;ve also watched a parade of births and birthdays of close friends go past without waving hello or telling them how much I care.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is all a bit maudlin, for which I&#8217;m sorry. Knowing my own faults does not transmute them to virtues, and telling you my faults will not serve as an apology for the hurts they have caused.</div><div><br /></div><div>What can one do but try to change?</div></div>

I know what one can do. Come home :P<br />We&#39;re missing you around here, brainiac.<br /><br />Glad you&#39;re enjoying London. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to find a way to balance your high-falootin&#39; new career and the rest of your life. We&#39;ll be here, whenever you get the chance to visit.<br /><br />Oh, by the way: Layla and Elsa both wanted me to pass on a rasberry, but it&#39;s tough to get the point across in text. <br />Here goes: phththhphphhthhthththh</div>

<div>I&#8217;ve just got back from a seven week stint in Australia and New Zealand. I left two books in Tasmania, but still managed to come back with eight books in my luggage. Books are big and heavy and I&#8217;m sick of carting them around the world watching them get damaged.</div><div><br /></div><div>It&#8217;s time for me to get an electronic book reader. I&#8217;ve resisted for a while because books are not only big and heavy, they are also wonderful and mysterious and almost sacred. Benny once told me that the physical book is the frame for the actual book, much like a bottle is the frame for wine. In both cases, the container has its own beauty, separate from but related to the thing inside that gladdens and warms the heart.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, I cannot abide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> for books.</div><div><br /></div><div>Which electronic book reader should I get? I would love to hear your recommendations. The single essential is that I must be able to load it with non-DRMed books in open formats (PDF, text, HTML).</div></div>

Thanks for the tips guys. Battery life is definitely important &#8211; I wonder if the Nook does better if wifi is turned off.<br /><br />Also, I guess Apple might be bringing out something tomorrow.</div>

Kindle large-screen is what I&#39;m planning on getting.<br /><br />It can load pdf&#39;s and a couple of the open book formats, and I&#39;m told there should be a software refresh soon to add another.<br /><br />Also the kindle DRM format is broken, so books bought on amazon in that format can be unlocked, backed up and loaded back into the kindle in open form.</div>

I absolutely love my Sony Reader Touch.  I have friends with the Kindle and Nook.  The Kindle&#39;s proprietary format makes things a little difficult to use your own content, and well, DRM is bad, mmkay. The Nook and the Reader both do epub, but the Nook&#39;s battery life doesn&#39;t touch the Readers.  You might have seen me with mine in New Zealand.  I didn&#39;t charge it the entire time I was there and I managed to read three whole books.</div>

Life&#8217;s going OK right now, but there&#8217;s a lot of travel.<div><br /></div><div>Just after settling into my flat in London, I&#8217;ve had to travel to Mooloolaba, which is in Queensland and is gorgeous. I&#8217;ve had a fun week here hacking with the Bazaar crew. Tomorrow morning I&#8217;m off to Dallas, Texas for a week and then back home to London.</div><div><br /></div><div>After then, I&#8217;ll be in London for two weeks before heading back to Tassie for Lizzie&#8217;s wedding. I&#8217;ll be there for three weeks. If you&#8217;re going to be in Tassie between December 5th and Christmas, get in touch.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, I&#8217;ve got a choice. I&#8217;ve got a thing in New Zealand in mid-January, so I might actually stay in the Antipodes until then, or I might head back to London.</div><div><br /></div><div>Still trying to figure out what my February plans are.

The flat hunt continues. <div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, I walked back from a late, greasy dinner to my studio in Kensington. I stopped at a café where people where smoking and laughing on the outdoor tables and went in to see if they had cannoli.</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ve been here before. It&#8217;s a charming little places with an atmosphere that promises much better coffee than you&#8217;ll actually get. They do pizza, and the waitresses sound Italian, but they don&#8217;t have any cannoli. I got a hot chocolate instead.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the table by the window, two men are concentrating over a chess board. They both look in their fifties and divorced. They&#8217;ve brought their own digital chess clock, so they probably know what they&#8217;re doing. Also, there&#8217;s the look in their eyes. The board is everything to them. Thousands of possible futures are ticking through their inner vision: areas of play, possible weaknesses, exchanges that must be made. I&#8217;ve never been good at chess, but I miss that deep, all-encompassing concentration.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn&#8217;t talk to them. I thought of hovering silently until I could at least see who was winning, but it was getting late and I don&#8217;t think they would have liked it. I just took my hot chocolate and left, my thoughts scattering in hundred different directions.</div></div>

Right now, I&#8217;m sitting on my bed in a very small studio in Kensington. I&#8217;ve been living in this small studio with its single bed for two weeks now. This is my first home in London.<br /><br />Some weeks ago, I&#8217;d been offered a promotion within Canonical. Circumstances made this a difficult decision, with me being forced to choose between two paths, each of which promising great good and little ill. I chose the promotion since  it seemed the more interesting mistake to make, and so far I haven&#8217;t regretted it. However, to follow the metaphor along its natural, bubbling course, the path has at times been a rocky one.<br /><br />A day or two after that, my former flatmate and landlord asked me to leave his flat, since he wanted someone he could hang out with, and that he and I were from different worlds. Both he and I were aware that when I moved he said &#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for a friend&#8221;, so this came as a shock to me.<br /><br />This meant that I&#8217;d have to move to London sooner than I&#8217;d wanted to. I had wanted to stay in Sydney, go to Chris &amp; Sam&#8217;s wedding, have a last go at actually <span style="font-style: italic;">living</span> there. There was also the Meeting: a week-long talk between all of the team leads on my product. Organizing the Meeting is very much at the core of my new position, I needed time to prepare, to research, to gather data and to talk to people. Moving so soon meant that my preparation time would be split between preparing the Meeting and relocating to another country.<br /><br />As it stands, and thanks largely to the gracious hospitality of my friends Andrew &amp; Mary, I&#8217;ve arrived safely in London, navigated the Meeting and am almost ready to begin really looking for a permanent place to live. This weekend though, I&#8217;m resting, since I&#8217;ve been sprinting along the path for weeks.</div>

You didn&#39;t mention your new title for one of two reasons:<br />1) You don&#39;t want to come across as blowing your own horn,<br />2) It&#39;s not public knowledge yet.<br /><br />If it&#39;s the former reason, what title have you taken?</div>

Months ago, I was perusing my friend Martin&#8217;s bookshelf on a warm night in Buenos Aires. Martin&#8217;s a native Spanish speaker and enjoys literature, so it ought not have been too surprising that he had &#8220;La Idiota&#8221; by Dostoyevsky on his shelf. All of his fiction was in Spanish, which surprised me because his English is excellent and there are many wonderful books in English.<br /><br />All of this triggered a conversation and much thinking, which ended up in a list of files that sat on my desktop. Allow me now to share this list with you.<br /><br />Here are the books that I would recommend to fluent but non-native English speaker to read in English.<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Of Mice and Men</span>, John Steinbeck</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Catcher in the Rye</span>, J. D. Salinger</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Pride and Prejudice</span>, Jane Austen</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Lolita</span>, Vladimir Nabakov</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Jane Eyre</span>, Charlotte Brontë</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Catch 22</span>, Joseph Heller</li></ul>There are others I could recommend, much of George Orwell and Mark Twain, perhaps some Raymond Chandler or Arthur Conan Doyle. But I think the books above are all excellent books, stylistically and otherwise.</div>
