A new study has just been published revealing that DVD titles starting with the letter &#8220;F&#8221; are up to seven times as popular as any other. &#8220;If this is true, Hollywood as we know it will be changed forever&#8221;, says one industry observer.<br /><br />Scientists conducted a survey over a wide variety of DVDs purchased by consumers, plotting the number of films purchased against the first letter of their title. Although they expected the graph to be flat, indicating that each letter was equally popular, they found that F was more popular by far. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how to explain it&#8221;, lamented one researcher, &#8220;our best theory so far is that it&#8217;s hard-wired into the brain&#8221;.<br /><br />The result has provoked a fierce reaction in the scientific community, with many criticizing the finding by blaming sloppy methods and a biased political agenda in an effort to discount the evidence.

I have a similar theory that the best bands start with &#39;B&#39;.  It&#39;s always the biggest section in the music stores.  <BR/><BR/>Beatles, Beach Boys, Birthday Party, Black Sabbath, Blondie, B-52&#39;s, Belle &amp; Sebastian, The Buzzcocks, Badly Drawn Boy, Beck, Blur, Brian Jonestown Massacre, David Bowie, The Byrds, The Beastie Boys, etc.</div>

I read <span style="font-style: italic;">Surprised by Joy</span> the other night. Some reactions:<br /><ul><li>We learn <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing</span> at school.

I wonder what he would have thought of email.<br /></li><li>His &#8220;perfect day&#8221; only included about six hours of work.

I mean not only that there might be a push away from, say, classical Greek among students (although that too) but that if told &#8220;design a curriculum for gentleman of leisure&#8221; and &#8220;design a curriculum for the great unwashed masses&#8221; that, independent of student demand, a different curriculum may result.</div>

Do you mean that to educate more people (e.g. lower classes, women) one simply has to provide subjects that said people are actually interested in? Again, not saying that women and lower class people are philistines, just that most people live their whole lives never regretting for a single moment their ignorance of classical Greek.<BR/><BR/>The &#8220;feminisation&#8221; point is a good one. I wonder if a related thing is that teachers now do more work. I wonder if teachers of yore had more time to pursue their own interests, more closely matching the academics of today. Without that carrot, I can see why the people who can teach such things would disappear.<BR/><BR/>I have more thoughts, but need more time to put them in words. Thanks for the good comment.</div>

A question that occurs to me is whether the difference in schooling is related to:<BR/><BR/>a. the increased Year 12 retention rate overall and the likely lower average intelligence of Year 12 graduates now<BR/><BR/>or, more disturbingly<BR/><BR/>b. the vastly increased retention rate among specific demographics (ie lower classes, women)<BR/><BR/>By b I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;actually lower classes and women are dumb&#8221; but&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what I mean. Is this something that was traded off as something that only wealthy lads could possibly have a use for? (The high school I know that still produces graduates with a couple more reading languages than they entered with happens to be one of the most expensive in the country <I>and</I> has an admission test <I>and</I> only admits boys, not helpful in distinguishing a and b.)<BR/><BR/>Actually, part of what would be going on would be that the people who can teach the kinds of things you are talking about have disappeared and that <I>is</I> related to the feminisation of teaching. Not so much that women couldn&#8217;t teach that as that the feminisation of teaching went hand-in-hand with significantly lower salaries and respect for teaching as a profession. (Very common historically as women enter a profession.)<BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s also related to the removal of drilling as a pedagogical technique. I&#8217;m conflicted on the question of drilling. For some reason, in spite of having an excellent memory and a superb high school academic performance, whenever I imagine a drilling education I see myself as the one being rapped over the knuckles with a ruler for screwing up yet another conjugation.</div>

Just finished a massive &#8220;Weekly Review&#8221;, a time of going through all my notes, papers, flagged emails, desktop icons and processing them to see what they are and what I need to do about them. It&#8217;s also a time for going through my reminder lists, getting them up-to-date and making sure everything is heading a long as normal.<br /><br />This time, I spent about four hours. If I actually <span style="font-style: italic;">finished</span> my GTD refresh last weekend, it would have taken less time. I don&#8217;t feel particularly cleaner or more productive yet, but there are definitely fewer loose threads. I&#8217;m also surprised by how many good ideas I&#8217;ve had languishing inside my head: I&#8217;m itching for a weekend or two to spend hacking and writing.</div>

So I know that this totally doesn&#8217;t apply to you at this point in time&#8230; but have you given any thought to the whole thing about having work at home and having integrated systems? <BR/><BR/>Cos it seems to me that having a weekly review is not only extremely hard to fit into my week now&#8230; it&#8217;s also like I&#8217;d have to do two of them. Otherwise I don&#8217;t have access to everything I need in both contexts. Plus, I&#8217;d feel a bit guilty about taking up work time doing personal review stuff. <BR/><BR/>Any thoughts?<BR/><BR/>I so want this system to work!</div>

My weekly reviews take one to two hours and I have a lot of projects underway.  It seems the most difficult part of GTD for folks is the weekly review, and most of the difficulty originates from just not doing it.<BR/><BR/>I’ve written a recent post on the weekly review, entitled, the Five W’s of a Weekly GTD Review that you and your readers might find interesting at http://johnkendrickonline.com John</div>

One day, perhaps a day far off, I would like to move to New Zealand and start my own town. I would call it <span style="font-style: italic;">Blough</span> and I would be the Mayor of Blough.<br /><br />Blough would be a special place because all eight correct pronunciations of its name would be correct. It&#8217;s main trades would be poker, jazz music, wind farms and confused tourists. My favourite pronunciation would be &#8220;Blup&#8221;.</div>

&#8220;Should&#8221; is the worst word in the English language. &#8220;Gubernatorial&#8221; is kind of bad, but reminds me of peanut butter and jam sandwiches. &#8220;Envisage&#8221; and &#8220;utilize&#8221; are both terrible, but at least I know what they&#8217;re getting at. &#8220;Should&#8221; is plain ambiguous.<br /><br />Consider, if you will, a thirsty self:<br /><br />Self: &#8220;When will my drink arrive?&#8221;<br />Other: &#8220;Your drink should come out with the mains, sir.&#8221;<br /><br />Now this obviously means &#8220;the drink will come out with the main meals unless something terrible and unexpected happens&#8221;. In other words, Other <span style="font-style: italic;">expects</span> it to come out with the mains, he <span style="font-style: italic;">anticipates </span>it.<br /><br />But there&#8217;s another meaning,<br /><br />Self: &#8220;When are drinks served?&#8221;<br />Other: &#8220;Drinks should be served with the mains.&#8221;<br /><br />See? This isn&#8217;t anticipation, this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">moral imperative</span>. Drinks <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>be served with mains, the nations <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> beat their swords into ploughshares, you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> listen to what I have to say.<br /><br />This comes up surprisingly often when talking about bugs and changes to software. I&#8217;m a little sick of it, but I don&#8217;t have any good alternative.</div>

That&#8217;s why I like <I>shall</I>. Apart from the fact that the meanings of <I>will</I> and  <I>shall</I> can be inverted depending on the subject, which is just confusing, the two verbs gave a colour to the language that has been lost since everyone started using <I>will</I>  for everything.<BR/><BR/>So when the fix is in all likelihood going to be completed by Thursday, you could say it <I>will</I> be in by then, when you&#8217;re implying that you&#8217;re determined for the fix to occur by Thursday you can say the it <I>shall</I> happen by then, and when you&#8217;re talking about an imperative, you can say that this is what <I>ought</I> to happen.</div>

Oh ho ho, how wrong you are!<BR/><BR/>UK English includes both &#8220;utilize&#8221; and &#8220;utilise&#8221;, with &#8220;utilize&#8221; being preferred by the Oxford English Dictionary. <BR/><BR/>The insistence on using &#8220;-ise&#8221; is an overreaction to US English, which only allows &#8220;-ize&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Words that come directly from French are an exception (e.g. advertise, enterprise).</div>

If you are ever in Hobart on a Monday evening, it&#8217;s worth dropping into Onba (just opposite the Republic) for their Open Mic Night.<br /><br />Onba opened up some time after I left Hobart. It&#8217;s a smallish place that does tapas, cocktails, wine, beer, live music, up-market cafe meals, free(ish) Internet access and decent coffee. The atmosphere is great and the whisky selection is small yet tasteful. Your average Sydney pub has nothing on this.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect at the open mic session. I mean, I figured things would be pretty laid-back and friendly, but I wasn&#8217;t sure about what kind of music they&#8217;d have, or how good it would be. First thing I see when I went up the stairs was my friend Alistair playing guitar accompanying two people on bongos and a chap on one of those hand-held things with keyboards that you blow into. I recognized one of the bongo players, since I had glared at him murderously the day before when he dared to play during my 2pm breakfast.<br /><br />It was a bit more world / folk than I&#8217;m used to, but it was good for all that. After Al stepped down, the guy on the melodica (yay learning) swapped places with the non-breakfast bongo player and did some improv. That was fun.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of the evening (except, perhaps, for the fact that Talisker costs $26 a glass) was hearing Al sing some of his own songs. I&#8217;d heard some of his stuff a few years back at the turn of the century and it was all well-polished and what-have-you, but since then&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I guess I was surprised at how much I enjoyed his music and how much it affected me. I could pull it all apart and say how his singing is much better and how he&#8217;s obviously more relaxed and that live acoustic in a nice pub is more appropriate to the songs than a professionally mixed recording in an office—I could do that—but I&#8217;ll leave that to the professionals.<br /><br />Also, you&#8217;ve probably forgotten how good Prince is (was). This is OK, he&#8217;s been dormant for a while and his recent stuff isn&#8217;t great. Still, you should take yourself down to your record store and find something that has <span style="font-style: italic;">Raspberry Beret</span> on it. One guy at Onba played a warm acoustic cover, good enough to make me shut up and listen.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">the kind u find</span></div>

I&#8217;ve just made some custard from scratch. The flavour is a lot better than my previous attempt, which had way too much vanilla and sugar. Sadly, I overcooked this batch, which means there&#8217;s lots of little lumps. I could strain them out, but I don&#8217;t have a strainer.<br /><br />Next time!</div>
