Things have been rather busy around here for me. I&#8217;m heading off to London for a two-week epic hacking adventure with the rest of my colleagues, and the preparation has taken up all of my free time.<br /><br />Well, not quite <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>. I&#8217;ve also just purchased a <a href="http://www-604.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=10000036&amp;catalogId=-36&amp;langId=036&amp;categoryId=4611686018425096207&amp;seriesid=2060574">new laptop</a> and have been spending a fair bit of time getting it ready to use as a development machine. I&#8217;m quite enamoured of its light weight and rugged keyboard.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also been reading a fair bit:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Economics</span>, The Economist Group</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Master and Commander<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span></span></span>Patrick O&#8217;Brian</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fionovar Tapestry</span> (again), Guy Gavriel Kay</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Book of Commonsense Investing</span>, John Bogle<br /></li></ul>And the occasional Gerard Manley Hopkins poem. What I really want is another vast book to lose myself in, like <span style="font-style: italic;">House of Leaves</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Jonathan Strange</span> — I guess they don&#8217;t grow on trees though.</div>

Thanks for the recommendations Benny.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve given up on Neal Stephenson. <I>Cryptonomicon</I> was great, but the follow-up, <I>Quicksilver</I> was pretty terrible from start to finish.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ll have a look at USA though.</div>

<a href="http://puzzling.org/identity/">Mary</a> recently posted about the Government&#8217;s <a href="http://puzzling.org/logs/thoughts/2008/October/14/internet-filtering">Internet filtering proposal</a>, exhorting readers to write a letter to the Minister and Shadow Minister responsible for this area.<br /><br />I always mean well with these things, but never get around to doing anything.

Do not use LaTeX, LyX, reST, HTML, SGML, Docbook, Lore, MediaWiki, Emacs, Gobby, TextMate, Vim, WordPress, Twitter or Facebook. It is impossible to write a letter using any of these things. I recommend OpenOffice Word Processor.</li><li>Type your full name and postal address.

Even if you don&#8217;t care, <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">this talk by Sir Ken Robinson</a> is funny, raises some good points and is only about fifteen minutes long.</div>

A fantastic talk that raises so many things for me. Let me offload (I actually wrote &#8220;overload&#8221; first!?):<BR/><BR/>- In countries where creativity *is* valued (eg dance in Latin America) the education system is dry and involves rote learning only (not that this isn&#8217;t a form of intelligence). So a culture that values creativity in general doesn&#8217;t necessary value it in education. <BR/><BR/>- I feel really strongly about this sort of thing. I think of very talented people who don&#8217;t realise they&#8217;re talented and who might even think they&#8217;re dumb or a failure. Everyone - including people with disabilities - has something to offer and something that will bring them pleasure. <BR/><BR/>- What has helped me realise my talents and creativity is: being told of my talents; being given free reign (to do things my way or to decide what I will do full stop); being encouraged; being understood and supported through the glitches; being given wise suggestions/guidance. This was done (as you know) in the context of a church apprenticeship. <BR/><BR/>- I think the Christian idea of different people having different gifts, each person occupying a different, valuable part in the body has a lot to offer. <BR/><BR/>- Maybe the trickest thing educationally is that the teacher won&#8217;t share all the students&#8217; gifts and it&#8217;s difficult to teach people stuff *you* don&#8217;t Know. But maybe that&#8217;s where the model I experienced in my apprenticeship comes in. <BR/>How does all this fit with what you (used to?) think about how schools should just be to teach reading and writing and other things are for the other things? <BR/><BR/>Fi</div>

Science may have the answer.</span><br /><br />Getting an &#8216;F&#8221; might no longer bear the sorry connotations of failure. A new study has just been published revealing that DVD titles starting with the letter &#8220;F&#8221; are up to seven times as popular as any other. &#8220;If this is true, Hollywood as we know it will be changed forever&#8221;, says one industry observer.<br /><br />Scientists conducted a survey over a wide variety of DVDs purchased by consumers, plotting the number of films purchased against the first letter of their title. Although they expected the graph to be flat, indicating that each letter was equally popular, they found that F was more popular by far. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how to explain it&#8221;, lamented one researcher, &#8220;our best theory so far is that it&#8217;s hard-wired into the brain&#8221;.<br /><br />The result has provoked a fierce reaction in the scientific community, with many criticizing the finding by blaming sloppy methods and a biased political agenda in an effort to discount the evidence. Others, however, are taking the news in stride, with Jerry Bruckheimer beginning work on a new film about three rabbits sent to colonize a new world, tentatively titled <span style="font-style: italic;">First, Fecund and Furred</span>.</div>

I have a similar theory that the best bands start with &#39;B&#39;.  It&#39;s always the biggest section in the music stores.  <BR/><BR/>Beatles, Beach Boys, Birthday Party, Black Sabbath, Blondie, B-52&#39;s, Belle &amp; Sebastian, The Buzzcocks, Badly Drawn Boy, Beck, Blur, Brian Jonestown Massacre, David Bowie, The Byrds, The Beastie Boys, etc.</div>

I mean not only that there might be a push away from, say, classical Greek among students (although that too) but that if told &#8220;design a curriculum for gentleman of leisure&#8221; and &#8220;design a curriculum for the great unwashed masses&#8221; that, independent of student demand, a different curriculum may result.</div>

Do you mean that to educate more people (e.g. lower classes, women) one simply has to provide subjects that said people are actually interested in? Again, not saying that women and lower class people are philistines, just that most people live their whole lives never regretting for a single moment their ignorance of classical Greek.<BR/><BR/>The &#8220;feminisation&#8221; point is a good one. I wonder if a related thing is that teachers now do more work. I wonder if teachers of yore had more time to pursue their own interests, more closely matching the academics of today. Without that carrot, I can see why the people who can teach such things would disappear.<BR/><BR/>I have more thoughts, but need more time to put them in words. Thanks for the good comment.</div>

A question that occurs to me is whether the difference in schooling is related to:<BR/><BR/>a. the increased Year 12 retention rate overall and the likely lower average intelligence of Year 12 graduates now<BR/><BR/>or, more disturbingly<BR/><BR/>b. the vastly increased retention rate among specific demographics (ie lower classes, women)<BR/><BR/>By b I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;actually lower classes and women are dumb&#8221; but&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what I mean. Is this something that was traded off as something that only wealthy lads could possibly have a use for? (The high school I know that still produces graduates with a couple more reading languages than they entered with happens to be one of the most expensive in the country <I>and</I> has an admission test <I>and</I> only admits boys, not helpful in distinguishing a and b.)<BR/><BR/>Actually, part of what would be going on would be that the people who can teach the kinds of things you are talking about have disappeared and that <I>is</I> related to the feminisation of teaching. Not so much that women couldn&#8217;t teach that as that the feminisation of teaching went hand-in-hand with significantly lower salaries and respect for teaching as a profession. (Very common historically as women enter a profession.)<BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s also related to the removal of drilling as a pedagogical technique. I&#8217;m conflicted on the question of drilling. For some reason, in spite of having an excellent memory and a superb high school academic performance, whenever I imagine a drilling education I see myself as the one being rapped over the knuckles with a ruler for screwing up yet another conjugation.</div>

Just finished a massive &#8220;Weekly Review&#8221;, a time of going through all my notes, papers, flagged emails, desktop icons and processing them to see what they are and what I need to do about them. It&#8217;s also a time for going through my reminder lists, getting them up-to-date and making sure everything is heading a long as normal.<br /><br />This time, I spent about four hours. If I actually <span style="font-style: italic;">finished</span> my GTD refresh last weekend, it would have taken less time. I don&#8217;t feel particularly cleaner or more productive yet, but there are definitely fewer loose threads. I&#8217;m also surprised by how many good ideas I&#8217;ve had languishing inside my head: I&#8217;m itching for a weekend or two to spend hacking and writing.</div>

So I know that this totally doesn&#8217;t apply to you at this point in time&#8230; but have you given any thought to the whole thing about having work at home and having integrated systems? <BR/><BR/>Cos it seems to me that having a weekly review is not only extremely hard to fit into my week now&#8230; it&#8217;s also like I&#8217;d have to do two of them. Otherwise I don&#8217;t have access to everything I need in both contexts. Plus, I&#8217;d feel a bit guilty about taking up work time doing personal review stuff. <BR/><BR/>Any thoughts?<BR/><BR/>I so want this system to work!</div>

My weekly reviews take one to two hours and I have a lot of projects underway.  It seems the most difficult part of GTD for folks is the weekly review, and most of the difficulty originates from just not doing it.<BR/><BR/>I’ve written a recent post on the weekly review, entitled, the Five W’s of a Weekly GTD Review that you and your readers might find interesting at http://johnkendrickonline.com John</div>

One day, perhaps a day far off, I would like to move to New Zealand and start my own town. I would call it <span style="font-style: italic;">Blough</span> and I would be the Mayor of Blough.<br /><br />Blough would be a special place because all eight correct pronunciations of its name would be correct. It&#8217;s main trades would be poker, jazz music, wind farms and confused tourists. My favourite pronunciation would be &#8220;Blup&#8221;.</div>

&#8220;Should&#8221; is the worst word in the English language. &#8220;Gubernatorial&#8221; is kind of bad, but reminds me of peanut butter and jam sandwiches. &#8220;Envisage&#8221; and &#8220;utilize&#8221; are both terrible, but at least I know what they&#8217;re getting at. &#8220;Should&#8221; is plain ambiguous.<br /><br />Consider, if you will, a thirsty self:<br /><br />Self: &#8220;When will my drink arrive?&#8221;<br />Other: &#8220;Your drink should come out with the mains, sir.&#8221;<br /><br />Now this obviously means &#8220;the drink will come out with the main meals unless something terrible and unexpected happens&#8221;. In other words, Other <span style="font-style: italic;">expects</span> it to come out with the mains, he <span style="font-style: italic;">anticipates </span>it.<br /><br />But there&#8217;s another meaning,<br /><br />Self: &#8220;When are drinks served?&#8221;<br />Other: &#8220;Drinks should be served with the mains.&#8221;<br /><br />See? This isn&#8217;t anticipation, this is a <span style="font-style: italic;">moral imperative</span>. Drinks <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>be served with mains, the nations <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> beat their swords into ploughshares, you <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> listen to what I have to say.<br /><br />This comes up surprisingly often when talking about bugs and changes to software. I&#8217;m a little sick of it, but I don&#8217;t have any good alternative.</div>

And thanks also for reinforcing the appropriate use of the letter z. It&#8217;s a great letter which is under-utilized.</div>

That&#8217;s why I like <I>shall</I>. Apart from the fact that the meanings of <I>will</I> and  <I>shall</I> can be inverted depending on the subject, which is just confusing, the two verbs gave a colour to the language that has been lost since everyone started using <I>will</I>  for everything.<BR/><BR/>So when the fix is in all likelihood going to be completed by Thursday, you could say it <I>will</I> be in by then, when you&#8217;re implying that you&#8217;re determined for the fix to occur by Thursday you can say the it <I>shall</I> happen by then, and when you&#8217;re talking about an imperative, you can say that this is what <I>ought</I> to happen.</div>

Oh ho ho, how wrong you are!<BR/><BR/>UK English includes both &#8220;utilize&#8221; and &#8220;utilise&#8221;, with &#8220;utilize&#8221; being preferred by the Oxford English Dictionary. <BR/><BR/>The insistence on using &#8220;-ise&#8221; is an overreaction to US English, which only allows &#8220;-ize&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Words that come directly from French are an exception (e.g. advertise, enterprise).</div>
