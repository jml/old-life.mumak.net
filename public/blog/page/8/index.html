A few months ago I started <a href="http://www.kbkickboxing.co.uk/">kickboxing in London</a>&nbsp;(terrible website, great people). I go to a great school that meets in various church halls and gyms around central London. It&#8217;s not boxxercising or tai-bo or whatever, but actual kicking-people-in-the-head kickboxing.<br /><br />Of course, I don&#8217;t actually kick people in the head. Unless they are really short. And our school is &#8220;semi-contact&#8221; â€“ we hit people as lightly as we can get away with.<br /><br />Some things are harder than I expected, surprisingly so:<br /><br /><ul><li>bouncing around on the spot (&#8220;keep shuffling!&#8221;) while keeping guard up</li><li>kicking; it&#8217;s hard work!</li><li>remembering whether to attack or defend during sparring drills</li><li>fitting all your gear into one bag</li><li>remembering to put your mouth guard in <i>before</i>&nbsp;putting on gloves</li><li>doing your ki-ai through a mouth guard</li><li>untangling hand wraps that have just been through the washing machine</li></ul><div>Here&#8217;s what has been surprisingly easy:</div><div><ul><li>getting into the training session and forgetting about my day</li><li>actually keeping it up</li></ul><div>I&#8217;ve been genuinely surprised by how much I&#8217;m enjoying it and how friendly the teachers and other students are. I&#8217;m aiming for my first belt in December, and have strange mix of fear, excitement and determination churning around in me.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</div><div><br /></div><div>PS. Apologies for the long hiatus. Hope I&#8217;m back now.</div></div>

Some recent reading I&#8217;d like to share with you:<br /><blockquote><p>Next morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I went into Motty&#8217;s room to investigate. I expected to find the fellow a wreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite chirpy, reading Gingery stories.</p><p>&#8220;What ho!&#8221; I said.</p><p>&#8220;What ho!&#8221; said Motty.</p><p>&#8220;What ho! What ho!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What ho! What ho! What ho!&#8221;</p><p>After that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation.</p></blockquote>From <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164">My Man Jeeves</a>, by P. G. Wodehouse.</div>

I just wrote a couple of cutting, incisive, witty paragraphs about the use of <a href="http://www.thegenevapush.com/christian-reflections/enormity-means-criminality.html">the word <q>enormity</q></a> that would have struck down all those who dare object to my opinion, which, by-the-by, is so obviously and manifestly correct that those who disagree must exist merely as a dark background on which to project the coloured lights of my intellect.<br /><br />Then I deleted it before posting, because when you argue about English usage, no-one wins.<br /><br />Now, I feel smug for being correct, and smug for doing the right thing. Smuggy, smuglish smugness. How pleasant to start ones weekend with an entirely unjustified sense of superiority and also eggs! Perhaps with those little <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A592481">soldiers</a> and some salt. Hmm, yes.<br /><br />My attention begins to flag, dear reader. Until next time.</div>

My mate Zac is in a band called <a href="http://hmasvendetta.com/">H.M.A.S. Vendetta</a>, and their single Boganheart is available to download from their website. Check it out.<br /><br />I&#8217;m off to Montreal for two weeks. The first week is work, the second is play. I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m going to do, other than bum around in a cool city. If you&#8217;ve got any tips, I&#8217;d love to hear them.</div>

Oh yes - be sure to go to La Ville de Quebec! It&#39;s so lovely. And to the hill looking over Montreal on the weekend when everyone&#39;s there. And the old centre which you will naturally go to anyway. I&#39;m also pretty sure that the countryside around there is beautiful. You could also pop over to Nova Scotia which is cool, but alas not French.</div>

Well, I was going to suggest going underground, but when I went back to a site I&#39;d found a few years ago via photoblogs there was a big story about how they&#39;d been arrested&#8230; so you know, prob not the best idea!<br /><br />http://www.undermontreal.com/</div>

I love checklists, but I always have trouble sharing that love with other people. Luckily, there&#8217;s now a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5542406/how-to-start-using-procedure-checklists-for-flawless-task-execution">article on checklists</a> on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a>. Now I&#8217;m going to refer people to that instead of David Allen&#8217;s book or my own vague fumblings about life being too short to think about boring stuff.<br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to see one I made, check out my checklist on&nbsp;<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess">how to release Twisted</a> (a free software project that I sometimes help out).</div>

I like <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>. A lot of her craziness rubs me the wrong way, and I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll ever be into Shiva Nata, but she&#8217;s very much worth listening to.<div><br /></div><div>She recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuff/more-ways-to-use-the-dammit-list/">Dammit List</a> â€“ a bunch of things that you will or will not do, dammit. I like this idea, because I could do a much better job at remembering who I am and what I stand for. Some readers will recall the <a href="http://www.apuritansmind.com/christianwalk/ResolutionsOfJonathanEdwards.htm">Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards</a>, which is only fair.</div><div><br /></div><div>Havi also recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuckification/the-book-of-you/">Book of You</a> â€“ a kind of record of your own patterns and habits that you can use to better understand who you are and how you work, and perhaps even help you to change for the better. It&#8217;s a little bit like informal scientific observation, and a little bit like the advice you&#8217;ll find in <a href="http://www.johnowen.org/">John Owen</a>&#8217;s works, particularly &#8221;<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/owen/mort.html">Of the Mortification of Sin in Believers</a>&#8221;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of a zany Yoga-teaching, Shivanaut pirate, duck-wearing blogger sharing ideas with two heavy-weight, dour, rigorous Puritans.

When you take old wisdom and present it as new, people listen â€“ really listen â€“ in a way that they don&#8217;t when you merely repeat the words of dead wise men. This is why weekly sermons and <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/07/a_kinder_gentle.php">TED talks like Alain de Botton</a>&#8217;s are such good things.</div><div><br /></div></div>

<div>Eleven isn&#8217;t a very big number. Eleven days isn&#8217;t a particularly long time. To be honest, I rarely think about time in chunks of eleven days. Seven days, yes. Thirty days, yes. Eleven days, no.</div><div><br /></div><div>But if you want to put something off, then eleven days seems like a good span to do it for. After all, you can always do it next week and then not get around to it until Thursday or Friday.</div><div><br /></div><div>Likewise, if you are compelled to postpone an engagement, then normally the same time next week won&#8217;t do â€“ things are pretty busy right now. Two weeks is too long, so you postpone for about eleven days.</div><div><br /></div><div>Could eleven days be the natural length of procrastination?</div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t think so, but it&#8217;s a fun idea to play with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yesterday happened to be the one hundred and twenty first day of the year. That means we&#8217;ve had eleven chances to put something off for eleven days. We only get about twenty more chances to do that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Or to put it another way, the year is a third over. The first act, the introduction is complete. Time for action.</div></div>

I&#8217;ve read so many good books over the last few years. Some of them seem to cry out to be read again. I know that if I read them again I&#8217;ll enjoy them more, I&#8217;ll know their excellences in a richer, deeper way than I do now.<div><br /></div><div>Here are the ones that leap to mind:<br /><div><div><ul><li><i>Persuasion</i>, Jane Austen</li><li><i>Underworld</i>, Don DeLillo</li><li><i>Les Miserables</i>, Victor Hugo</li><li><i>Ulysses</i>, James Joyce</li><li><i>Infinite Jest</i>, David Foster Wallace</li><li><i>War and Peace</i>, Leo Tolstoy</li></ul><div>But, should I read <i>War and Peace</i> again before I read <i>Anna Karenina</i> for the very first time? Life&#8217;s but a fleeting shadow.</div></div></div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Update:</b> How did I forget <i>Moby Dick</i>?</div></div>

I like Anna Karenina better too. Better plot and fewer preachy monologues if I recall correctly.</div>

Sadly, I haven&#39;t read any other DeLillo books. I want to read <i>Underworld</i> again partly because I enjoyed it, but mostly because I think there&#39;s depth there that I didn&#39;t fully appreciate the first time.<br /><br />Also, I didn&#39;t mention any Dostoyevsky in that list, because that goes without saying.</div>

I would vote <i>Anna Karenina</i> over <i>War and Peace</i>.  <i>Anna Karenina</i> is one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />I&#39;m surprised you liked <i>Underworld</i> so much.  I never could get into that one.  Practically any other DeLillo book is better, IMHO.</div>

And King jml opened his mouth and spoke to the peoples of the land, and he said, &#8220;Lo! There are vendors of chips that are neither salted nor hot, nay, the chips are not even warm. The cooks and merchants who profit from such chips are evil, and ruin marks their way. Therefore I will punish such evildoers and let their own misery fall upon them. Henceforth, all those who sell chips that are cold or chips that are unsalted shall be condemned to eat those chips, yea even at the point of sale.&#8221; And though the vendors of the chips that were cold and the cooks of the chips that were unsalted were afraid, the people of the land rejoiced, for wisdom was found in the heart of the king&#8217;s decree.</div>

A real chip shop should _ask_ if you want salt, unlike this part of the world.  And also not start with frozen chips dammit.<br /><br />Serving them cold is just very very wrong though.</div>
