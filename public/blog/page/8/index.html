I just got back from three hours of kick-boxing, and am pretty exhausted – &#8220;cream crackered&#8221; as they say over here. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been in over a week, since I had a cold for much of last week.<br /><br />Apart from the obvious physical demands, kick-boxing is quite demanding mentally, at least to the beginner. It&#8217;s a little bit like being a beginner at driving, in that there are many things you have to remember to do correctly <i>all of the time, </i>there is no time at which you can forget any of them.<br /><br />You have to keep your guard up at all times, fists clenched at your temples. Your fists have to be clenched properly and tightly with the thumb tucked away over the fingers. You must keep shuffling: moving around, bouncing, bobbing, weaving at all times – even when listening to instructions. &nbsp;But you mustn&#8217;t shuffle during a combo. &nbsp;During the combo, pivot for reverse punches, hook punches, uppercuts, side kicks and roundhouses, but stay straight for front kicks, jabs and back hands. Ki-ai (i.e. shout, for me it&#8217;s sort of a &#8220;Tsuh!&#8221; sound) at the end of your combo. Keep shuffling. Don&#8217;t punch or kick too hard, just &#8220;sting&#8221; the pad / sparring partner. &nbsp;Return hands to guard as quickly as possible after a punch.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a lot to keep in mind. &nbsp;The nice thing is that, like driving, more and more of it becomes automatic as you keep doing it. Still, I&#8217;m a bit worried that I&#8217;ll have a brain-related failure during my grading on Sunday week.</div>

ok, so maybe &quot;really good&quot; at all three was a little inaccurate</div>

This reminds me of learning to ski and dance - and drive. Each time I found the process highly unpleasant. But the dogged perseverance needed to aquire these skills has served me well. *And* I&#39;ve actually managed to get really good at all three. Now I relish the fact that the basics come automatically, leaving me to attend to grace and expression. It&#39;s totally worth it.</div>

<blockquote></blockquote>Just came across this post that I had started a while ago and never finished. I thought it was interesting enough to share.<br /><br />I <s>recently</s> watched <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html">Alain de Botton talk about a gentler, kinder success</a>, and I recommend that you do the same.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear echoes of earlier writing in his arguments. Indeed, it showed remarkable discipline to be able to talk about the great role that chance plays in personal success without quoting <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209:11&amp;version=NIV">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.<br /><br />De Botton also discussed envy. Envy, he argues, is largely created by a belief in equality. I think he&#8217;s right, and that he&#8217;s right to say it. However, I could have sworn I read a similar thing in something C. S. Lewis wrote, and it turns out I did: <a href="http://screwtapeblogs.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/screwtape-proposes-a-toast/">Screwtape Proposes a Toast</a>. It is one of Lewis&#8217;s poorer pieces where he writes about the English education system and small government and other claptrap under the guise of writing about the human spiritual condition.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Lewis&#8217;s essay feels horribly dated and rather cantankerous. De Botton&#8217;s talk is friendly and witty and warm. Ecclesiastes is beautiful, concise and somewhat disheartening. True things stay true, and bear repeating in new ways and new contexts.</div></div>

I&#8217;ve been eligible to apply for a driving license for a little over a decade now, but I still haven&#8217;t got one. &nbsp;Partly it&#8217;s because of an unusual schooling, partly because I&#8217;ve lived in walking or public transport distance of everywhere I wanted to go, partly because I just don&#8217;t get off on cars the way some do but mostly because I&#8217;m lazy.<br /><br />However, driving is an important life skill, since a decade is long enough&nbsp;and since not having a car is a pain when I visit Tasmania, I am learning to drive.<br /><br />Of course, this means learning to drive <i>in London. </i>Here&#8217;s something of how it goes.<br /><br />I wake up at a time carefully calculated to be as late as possible, but to give me enough time to consume and absorb my usual pot of coffee before the lesson starts. I leave the house and look around to discover whether today is going to be a driving in fog day or a driving in the rain day. I then turn up the mews and carefully navigate the maze of construction work (at one point vaulting a guard rail) just so my driving instructor can pick me up in a spot that&#8217;s outside of the congestion zone.<br /><br />As he pulls up in the middle of the busy main road just off Paddington station, I dive into the tiny car, shake his hand and we drive off to the canals some four or five minutes away.&nbsp;Then we swap around, I take the wheel and do my best to enjoy two of the more stressful hours of my week.<br /><br />I spend those hours in a constant state of crisis management. London grew up for people, horses and carts, not automobiles, so the streets are winding and narrow. This is partly what I love about the city, but it does make learning to drive that much harder.<br /><br />The roads have lanes in much the same way that Britain has a constitution: they exist; they are not written down; they are generally followed and your safest bet is to do the same thing as whoever comes before you.<br /><br />A two-way street inevitably has cars parked along both sides, making it wide enough for only one care at a time. Halfway through there will be some kind of road works, just beyond which a mother will be pushing a pram out to cross the street. If I manage to dodge the road works and heroically save the child&#8217;s life, a delivery van will reverse out of its parking spot to cross both of the lanes. Then there are the buses and cyclists and cab drivers who are all deliberately trying to get me to have an accident.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The real highlight is when I get to enjoy the freedom of the open road: no traffic, no obstructions, just me zooming along at a reckless thirty miles an hour (50km/h). I tell you, I feel almost giddy.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><br />Though each week I&#8217;m getting a little bit better. I&#8217;m really hoping to be able to do the test and pass before I head to Australia this April, so I can pootle along the Southern Outlet behind the logging trucks and find my way into the comforts of Hobart.</div>

Narrow lanes, road works, prams, reversing vans&#8230; surely you forgot the enormous pane of glass being carried across the road by some hapless tradesmen.  Perhaps next lesson?<br /><br />Good luck with the lessons and eventual test!</div>

A few months ago I started <a href="http://www.kbkickboxing.co.uk/">kickboxing in London</a>&nbsp;(terrible website, great people). I go to a great school that meets in various church halls and gyms around central London. It&#8217;s not boxxercising or tai-bo or whatever, but actual kicking-people-in-the-head kickboxing.<br /><br />Of course, I don&#8217;t actually kick people in the head. Unless they are really short. And our school is &#8220;semi-contact&#8221; – we hit people as lightly as we can get away with.<br /><br />Some things are harder than I expected, surprisingly so:<br /><br /><ul><li>bouncing around on the spot (&#8220;keep shuffling!&#8221;) while keeping guard up</li><li>kicking; it&#8217;s hard work!</li><li>remembering whether to attack or defend during sparring drills</li><li>fitting all your gear into one bag</li><li>remembering to put your mouth guard in <i>before</i>&nbsp;putting on gloves</li><li>doing your ki-ai through a mouth guard</li><li>untangling hand wraps that have just been through the washing machine</li></ul><div>Here&#8217;s what has been surprisingly easy:</div><div><ul><li>getting into the training session and forgetting about my day</li><li>actually keeping it up</li></ul><div>I&#8217;ve been genuinely surprised by how much I&#8217;m enjoying it and how friendly the teachers and other students are. I&#8217;m aiming for my first belt in December, and have strange mix of fear, excitement and determination churning around in me.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</div><div><br /></div><div>PS. Apologies for the long hiatus. Hope I&#8217;m back now.</div></div>

Some recent reading I&#8217;d like to share with you:<br /><blockquote><p>Next morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I went into Motty&#8217;s room to investigate. I expected to find the fellow a wreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite chirpy, reading Gingery stories.</p><p>&#8220;What ho!&#8221; I said.</p><p>&#8220;What ho!&#8221; said Motty.</p><p>&#8220;What ho! What ho!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;What ho! What ho! What ho!&#8221;</p><p>After that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation.</p></blockquote>From <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164">My Man Jeeves</a>, by P. G. Wodehouse.</div>

I just wrote a couple of cutting, incisive, witty paragraphs about the use of <a href="http://www.thegenevapush.com/christian-reflections/enormity-means-criminality.html">the word <q>enormity</q></a> that would have struck down all those who dare object to my opinion, which, by-the-by, is so obviously and manifestly correct that those who disagree must exist merely as a dark background on which to project the coloured lights of my intellect.<br /><br />Then I deleted it before posting, because when you argue about English usage, no-one wins.<br /><br />Now, I feel smug for being correct, and smug for doing the right thing. Smuggy, smuglish smugness. How pleasant to start ones weekend with an entirely unjustified sense of superiority and also eggs! Perhaps with those little <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A592481">soldiers</a> and some salt. Hmm, yes.<br /><br />My attention begins to flag, dear reader. Until next time.</div>

My mate Zac is in a band called <a href="http://hmasvendetta.com/">H.M.A.S. Vendetta</a>, and their single Boganheart is available to download from their website.

Oh yes - be sure to go to La Ville de Quebec! It&#39;s so lovely. And to the hill looking over Montreal on the weekend when everyone&#39;s there. And the old centre which you will naturally go to anyway. I&#39;m also pretty sure that the countryside around there is beautiful. You could also pop over to Nova Scotia which is cool, but alas not French.</div>

I love checklists, but I always have trouble sharing that love with other people. Luckily, there&#8217;s now a great <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5542406/how-to-start-using-procedure-checklists-for-flawless-task-execution">article on checklists</a> on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a>. Now I&#8217;m going to refer people to that instead of David Allen&#8217;s book or my own vague fumblings about life being too short to think about boring stuff.<br /><br />If you&#8217;d like to see one I made, check out my checklist on&nbsp;<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess">how to release Twisted</a> (a free software project that I sometimes help out).</div>

I like <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>. A lot of her craziness rubs me the wrong way, and I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll ever be into Shiva Nata, but she&#8217;s very much worth listening to.<div><br /></div><div>She recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuff/more-ways-to-use-the-dammit-list/">Dammit List</a> – a bunch of things that you will or will not do, dammit. I like this idea, because I could do a much better job at remembering who I am and what I stand for. Some readers will recall the <a href="http://www.apuritansmind.com/christianwalk/ResolutionsOfJonathanEdwards.htm">Resolutions of Jonathan Edwards</a>, which is only fair.</div><div><br /></div><div>Havi also recommends keeping a <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/stuckification/the-book-of-you/">Book of You</a> – a kind of record of your own patterns and habits that you can use to better understand who you are and how you work, and perhaps even help you to change for the better. It&#8217;s a little bit like informal scientific observation, and a little bit like the advice you&#8217;ll find in <a href="http://www.johnowen.org/">John Owen</a>&#8217;s works, particularly &#8221;<a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/owen/mort.html">Of the Mortification of Sin in Believers</a>&#8221;.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of a zany Yoga-teaching, Shivanaut pirate, duck-wearing blogger sharing ideas with two heavy-weight, dour, rigorous Puritans.
