What&#8217;s that word, the one for when people unite to achieve a single goal and spend effort, time, energy, creativity, nous, emotion, money, business cunning and sweat on some grand endeavour?<br /><br />The closest I&#8217;ve got is &#8220;industry&#8221;. It&#8217;s a shame the word doesn&#8217;t carry a sense of wonder and verve with it.</div>

I was thinking enterprise too.  Why not endeavour, or venture?  (Star) ship names are good.<BR/><BR/>The only thing I can think of that covers all those qualities is the building of the pyramids, how about pyramidise?</div>

enterprise comes from the French meaning something like &#8216;undertaking&#8217;.<BR/><BR/>perhaps this is helpful?</div>

Enterprise is close. The word is used and mocked a lot in IT circles, because it&#8217;s generally code for &#8220;big, bloated and slow&#8221;.<BR/><BR/>Mission is OK, but doesn&#8217;t have the grit I want.<BR/><BR/>Maybe I&#8217;m just going to have to actually say what I mean, rather than finding a pre-made word for it.</div>

I had meant to move this weekend just gone. I had arranged the truck, some friends to help and cleared away a space for my possessions in my new home.<br /><br />Sadly, I didn&#8217;t actually <span style="font-style: italic;">pack</span><span>. Like Pope Urban VII, I expected the universe to move around me. I&#8217;m going to try to move again next week. Right now, all of my books, CDs, DVDs and odds-and-ends are all packed. Boxes are scattered on my floor like Biblical allusions in a Nick Cave song.<br /><br />Instead of moving, I revamped <a href="http://mumak.net/">my website</a>, moved <a href="http://code.mumak.net/">my professional blog</a> and set up <a href="http://mumak.net/planet/atom.xml">a feed that aggregates both blogs</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://huwshimi.com/">Huw</a> and <a href="http://puzzling.org/">Mary</a> for their help.<br /><br /></span></div>

I&#8217;d say something about how you should have a moving party and co opt the help of friends, but: don&#8217;t. Just move yourself already. And then have a housewarming.</div>

<a href="http://stripeshop.metagnome.net/">Bice</a> asked me to translate &#8220;striving for boredom&#8221; into Latin. I&#8217;m slowly teaching myself Latin in my spare time, and am still very much a beginner. I couldn&#8217;t just translate it off the cuff, so here&#8217;s what I did.<br /><br />First, I looked up <span style="font-style: italic;">to strive</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">boredom</span> in my Latin dictionary. It offers <span style="font-style: italic;">contendere</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">to strive</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudo </span>for <span style="font-style: italic;">boredom</span>. Then I looked up <span style="font-style: italic;">for</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">For</span> has a lot of meanings. Does it refer to advantage, duration, price, being in lieu of something, a purpose or what? I figured &#8220;purpose&#8221; looked about right and of the two suggestions I picked <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span>, guessing that <span style="font-style: italic;">in</span> wasn&#8217;t quite right. I confirmed this by looking up the synonym <span style="font-style: italic;">towards</span>.<br /><br />The dictionary quite helpfully tells me that <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span> expects to be followed by an accusative. So, I flipped to the back of the dictionary where it explains how to turn a noun from the way it appears in the dictionary (i.e. the nominative case) into the accusative case.<br /><br />Guess what? Latin turns out to be pretty complicated! The forms of a noun don&#8217;t changed based on gender, as I had guessed, but on &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_declension">declension</a>&#8221;, a made up category of grammar even sillier than gender. I knew <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudo</span> was feminine, but not which declension it was. The dictionary didn&#8217;t give examples of feminine words ending with <span style="font-style: italic;">–do</span> so I resorted to the Internet. Googling for &#8220;lassitudo declension&#8221; quickly shewed it to be in <span style="font-style: italic;">declinatio tertia</span>.<br /><br />&#8220;Let&#8217;s see nominative, vocative, accusative—ah! <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudonēs</span> looks right&#8221;. Except that <span style="font-style: italic;">lassitudonēs</span> means &#8220;boredoms&#8221;. This prompted a short philosophical tangent whereby Bice and I discussed whether one could have multiple boredoms. Results were inconclusive. <span style="font-style: italic;">Lassitudem</span> looks to be right.<br /><br />So far, we have ______ <span style="font-style: italic;">ad lassitudem</span>. Time to learn verbs!<br /><br />This is where I got really confused. Is <span style="font-style: italic;">striving</span> is a gerund? I don&#8217;t think so. It would be if the motto were &#8220;Striving is great&#8221;, but in this case someone is actually striving.<br /><br />Tense was less tricky. It&#8217;s not past, it&#8217;s not future, pluperfect or future perfect. It&#8217;s not passive or subjunctive either, although I don&#8217;t think these are tenses. Present seems to be the only sensible choice, and the examples in the dictionary helped verify this. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contendere </span>ends with <span style="font-style: italic;">–ere</span> (not <span style="font-style: italic;">–ēre</span>!), so it looks like it&#8217;s in the third conjugation.<br /><br />Latin verbs, like German ones, really seem to need a person. <span style="font-style: italic;">Cogito</span> means <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> think</span>. Bice and I decided that &#8220;We&#8217;re striving&#8221; was the meaning we intended, so I went for third person. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contendo, contendis, contendit!</span><br /><br />A quick Google for &#8220;contendit ad&#8221; showed that others have used similar constructs, notably <span style="font-style: italic;">contendit ad perfectionem</span>, so at least it&#8217;s not an original mistake.<br /><br />So, that leaves us with <span style="font-style: italic;">contendit ad lassitudem</span>. Not this blogger&#8217;s motto, honestly!</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY PRESENTS<br />A SYDNEY IDEAS LECTURE<br /><span style="font-size:180%;">JOHN MICKLETHWAIT</span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:100%;">Thu 19 June 2008<br /><br /><br />John Micklethwait is the current editor of the Economist — a newspaper to which I subscribe. He tried to get us thinking using &#8220;provocative paranoia&#8221;. Sadly, I didn&#8217;t take notes, so I&#8217;ll have to dredge my memory for a possible later post.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">Cinema 04</span><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">Prince Caspian (M)</span><br /><span style="font-size:100%;">Wed 18/06/2008</span><br /><br /><br />Like the Micklethwait lecture, this doesn&#8217;t have any heroes. Unlike the lecture, it lacks decent villains too. At one point, the chief bad guy <span style="font-style: italic;">swirls his cape menacingly </span>as he steals the throne from Caspian. I spent the whole film thinking about <a href="http://www.crlamppost.org/darkside.htm">Philip Pullman&#8217;s opinions on Susan</a> and how Edmund seemed along for the ride (except for one awesome moment near the Stone Table).<br /><br />Just read the book: it&#8217;s cheaper, more enjoyable and won&#8217;t take much longer than watching the film.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span></div></div></div>

I missed out on going to church tonight due to an unfortunate accident with my laundry — I did all of it in one go, leaving me with neither socks nor clean outer garb.<br /><br />Instead I&#8217;ve idled a bit around the house, flicking through some Yeats and the Introduction to the Penguin edition of same. This bit&#8217;s worth repeating:<br /><blockquote>Yeats&#8217;s commitment to the potency of the word was also connected with his belief in the virtues of English as it was spoken in those parts of Ireland which had not yet been corrupted by the &#8216;base idiom&#8217; of the newspapers, … &#8216;a speech exhausted from abstraction&#8217;. In the Elizabethan period Irish writers &#8216;belonged to the old individual, poetical life, and spoke a language [Irish] in which it was all but impossible to think an abstract thought&#8217;.</blockquote>Later,<br /><blockquote>[Yeats] remembered that he had found himself &#8216;continually testing both my verse and my prose by translating it into dialect&#8217; … helping him &#8216;to get back to the definite and concrete away from modern abstractions&#8217;.<br /></blockquote>Which reminds me of Orwell&#8217;s translation of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=25&amp;chapter=9&amp;verse=11&amp;version=9&amp;context=verse">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a> into &#8220;modern English&#8221; from <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language</a>, and of the introduction to <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/">Roger Ebert</a>&#8217;s<a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/REVIEWS/969461084"> review of <span style="font-style: italic;">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</span></a>, which has these <span style="font-style: italic;">concrete</span> words:<br /><blockquote>The Indiana Jones movies were directed by <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/classifieds?category=search1&amp;SearchType=1&amp;q=Steven%20Spielberg&amp;Class=%25&amp;FromDate=19150101&amp;ToDate=20081231">Steven Spielberg</a> and written <br />by <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/classifieds?category=search1&amp;SearchType=1&amp;q=George%20Lucas&amp;Class=%25&amp;FromDate=19150101&amp;ToDate=20081231">George Lucas</a> and a small army of screenwriters, but they exist in a <br />universe of their own. Hell, they created it. All you can do is compare one to the other three. And even then, what will it get you? If you eat four pounds of sausage, how do you choose which pound tasted the best?</blockquote>Such a capable meat.<br /><br />Neighbours are getting noisy again, time to plot my escape.</div>

I&#8217;ve decided to move to Nick&#8217;s place in Lindfield. I&#8217;ve spoken with my property manager and expect to move there in a couple of weeks time. I&#8217;ll miss Glebe, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find ways to console myself.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also decided to take a break from World of Warcraft and focus on Free Software for a bit.<br /><br />Also, I now own a brand new filing cabinet. It is so beautiful and oblong.</div>

I&#8217;ve been living in a unit in Glebe for a few months now and am thinking of finding a sharehouse. In particular,  a sharehouse where everyone else has day jobs, so I can work from home without undue distraction.<br /><br />The dilemma I face is this: do I stay in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_West">Inner West</a>, or do I move to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a>? I <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> the Inner West more, but the North Shore is more convenient. O dilemma wretched! In particular, if I move to another place in the Inner West, then I should start to think seriously about switching to a more local church.<br /><br />That said, I&#8217;ll be looking at a place in Lindfield on the weekend — let&#8217;s see how it goes.</div>

Hey JML, good on you, I would love to do a personal blog but I&#8217;ve tried twice and got bogged, wisdom from my failures? Persevere and don&#8217;t worry too much about what you write. See when I wrote that, I actually looked back and thought &#8220;Is it really true that I would &#8216;love&#8217; to do a personal blog? In what sense do I mean &#8216;love&#8217;?&#8221; and so on. We&#8217;re up in Sydney this weekend until Tuesday morn (?) be good to see you if you&#8217;re about. We&#8217;re helping launch a book in your suburb actually.</div>
