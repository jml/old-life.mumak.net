The flat hunt continues. <div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, I walked back from a late, greasy dinner to my studio in Kensington. I stopped at a café where people where smoking and laughing on the outdoor tables and went in to see if they had cannoli.</div><div><br /></div><div>I&#8217;ve been here before. It&#8217;s a charming little places with an atmosphere that promises much better coffee than you&#8217;ll actually get. They do pizza, and the waitresses sound Italian, but they don&#8217;t have any cannoli. I got a hot chocolate instead.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the table by the window, two men are concentrating over a chess board. They both look in their fifties and divorced. They&#8217;ve brought their own digital chess clock, so they probably know what they&#8217;re doing. Also, there&#8217;s the look in their eyes. The board is everything to them. Thousands of possible futures are ticking through their inner vision: areas of play, possible weaknesses, exchanges that must be made. I&#8217;ve never been good at chess, but I miss that deep, all-encompassing concentration.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn&#8217;t talk to them. I thought of hovering silently until I could at least see who was winning, but it was getting late and I don&#8217;t think they would have liked it. I just took my hot chocolate and left, my thoughts scattering in hundred different directions.</div></div>

Right now, I&#8217;m sitting on my bed in a very small studio in Kensington. I&#8217;ve been living in this small studio with its single bed for two weeks now. This is my first home in London.<br /><br />Some weeks ago, I&#8217;d been offered a promotion within Canonical. Circumstances made this a difficult decision, with me being forced to choose between two paths, each of which promising great good and little ill. I chose the promotion since  it seemed the more interesting mistake to make, and so far I haven&#8217;t regretted it. However, to follow the metaphor along its natural, bubbling course, the path has at times been a rocky one.<br /><br />A day or two after that, my former flatmate and landlord asked me to leave his flat, since he wanted someone he could hang out with, and that he and I were from different worlds. Both he and I were aware that when I moved he said &#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for a friend&#8221;, so this came as a shock to me.<br /><br />This meant that I&#8217;d have to move to London sooner than I&#8217;d wanted to. I had wanted to stay in Sydney, go to Chris &amp; Sam&#8217;s wedding, have a last go at actually <span style="font-style: italic;">living</span> there. There was also the Meeting: a week-long talk between all of the team leads on my product. Organizing the Meeting is very much at the core of my new position, I needed time to prepare, to research, to gather data and to talk to people. Moving so soon meant that my preparation time would be split between preparing the Meeting and relocating to another country.<br /><br />As it stands, and thanks largely to the gracious hospitality of my friends Andrew &amp; Mary, I&#8217;ve arrived safely in London, navigated the Meeting and am almost ready to begin really looking for a permanent place to live. This weekend though, I&#8217;m resting, since I&#8217;ve been sprinting along the path for weeks.</div>

You didn&#39;t mention your new title for one of two reasons:<br />1) You don&#39;t want to come across as blowing your own horn,<br />2) It&#39;s not public knowledge yet.<br /><br />If it&#39;s the former reason, what title have you taken?</div>

Months ago, I was perusing my friend Martin&#8217;s bookshelf on a warm night in Buenos Aires. Martin&#8217;s a native Spanish speaker and enjoys literature, so it ought not have been too surprising that he had &#8220;La Idiota&#8221; by Dostoyevsky on his shelf. All of his fiction was in Spanish, which surprised me because his English is excellent and there are many wonderful books in English.<br /><br />All of this triggered a conversation and much thinking, which ended up in a list of files that sat on my desktop. Allow me now to share this list with you.<br /><br />Here are the books that I would recommend to fluent but non-native English speaker to read in English.<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Of Mice and Men</span>, John Steinbeck</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Catcher in the Rye</span>, J. D. Salinger</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Pride and Prejudice</span>, Jane Austen</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Lolita</span>, Vladimir Nabakov</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Jane Eyre</span>, Charlotte Brontë</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Catch 22</span>, Joseph Heller</li></ul>There are others I could recommend, much of George Orwell and Mark Twain, perhaps some Raymond Chandler or Arthur Conan Doyle. But I think the books above are all excellent books, stylistically and otherwise.</div>

I&#8217;m moving to London, and soon. I hate moving house. I&#8217;ve done it a lot and each time I do it I still hate it.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m aiming for:<br /><ul><li>move out of shared accommodation</li><li>ship some of my stuff to the UK</li><li>keep some of my stuff in luggage</li><li>sell or donate the rest of my stuff</li></ul>I&#8217;d dearly love someone to manage all of this for me, and am willing to pay a premium for it. If not, well, I&#8217;ve done it before (except for the UK bit).<br /><br />More info about the move later.</div>

London, baby! Awesome. Whenever you have any hassles with the moving logistics (and I hope that these are minimal), just remind yourself that you&#39;re moving to London. LONDON.</div>

We used http://www.pssremovals.com/ when we moved out to NZ.  We shipped some stuff by air and some by sea.  They did the job, I can&#39;t really think anything positive or negative to say apart from that.</div>

When one says that a thing is a &#8220;slippery slope&#8221;, one is obliged to prove that there is a slope and that it is indeed slippery. Likewise, a thin edge of the wedge is only relevant if there is a substantial &#8220;wedge&#8221; attached to the thin edge, and if there is some motive force behind said wedge. One might also have to demonstrate that a part of the wedge isn&#8217;t already in place, and that this is in fact a slightly fatter part of the wedge. In any case, once the wedge is fully driven in (or the end of the slope passed) some calamity ought to follow.<br /><br />In either figure of speech, there are three components:<br /><ol><li>A small movement in a dangerous or negative direction (an implicit instability; the thin edge)<br /></li><li>A near-unstoppable  force in that same direction (lubricated gravity; the implicit hammer)<br /></li><li>A highly dangerous or negative result (crashing at the bottom of the slope; splitting whatever the wedge is in)</li></ol>It&#8217;s well worth being conscious of each of these components when you use these metaphors. Some examples to consider, many of which are taken from actual arguments:<br /><ul><li>Mandatory Internet filtering</li><li>Allowing papists in the Royal Navy</li><li>Abandoning the Lord&#8217;s Prayer in Parliament</li><li>Using the proprietary software present in the firmware of a hotel elevator</li><li>Giving money to a beggar</li><li>Nationalizing banks</li><li>Not shaving tomorrow<br /></li></ul></div>

I kinda like to think of the slippery slope ending some great gaping chasm.<br /><br />Either way, calamity awaits.</div>

At my parents&#39; house there were large french windows that were basically sheet glass and as a child I both ran into them when I thought they were open (fortunately they were very solid shop-window glass) and, probably more entertaining for spectators, tried to lean on them when I thought they were shut.</div>

Bice, it was completely transparent. Nigh invisible.<br /><br />Mary, yes, it was entirely shattered. We had to replace it immediately since shards of glass sticking out from doorframes are not conducive to household peace of mind.<br /><br />And I honestly did walk into it. No unusual force at all.</div>
