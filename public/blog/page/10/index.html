I&#8217;m moving to London, and soon. I hate moving house. I&#8217;ve done it a lot and each time I do it I still hate it.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m aiming for:<br /><ul><li>move out of shared accommodation</li><li>ship some of my stuff to the UK</li><li>keep some of my stuff in luggage</li><li>sell or donate the rest of my stuff</li></ul>I&#8217;d dearly love someone to manage all of this for me, and am willing to pay a premium for it. If not, well, I&#8217;ve done it before (except for the UK bit).<br /><br />More info about the move later.</div>

London, baby! Awesome. Whenever you have any hassles with the moving logistics (and I hope that these are minimal), just remind yourself that you&#39;re moving to London. LONDON.</div>

We used http://www.pssremovals.com/ when we moved out to NZ.  We shipped some stuff by air and some by sea.  They did the job, I can&#39;t really think anything positive or negative to say apart from that.</div>

<span style="font-size:100%;">Of it, Virginia Woolf says, &#8220;Jane Austen looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly natural, shapely sentence proper for her own use and never departed from it.&#8221;<br /><br /></span></div>

When one says that a thing is a &#8220;slippery slope&#8221;, one is obliged to prove that there is a slope and that it is indeed slippery. Likewise, a thin edge of the wedge is only relevant if there is a substantial &#8220;wedge&#8221; attached to the thin edge, and if there is some motive force behind said wedge. One might also have to demonstrate that a part of the wedge isn&#8217;t already in place, and that this is in fact a slightly fatter part of the wedge. In any case, once the wedge is fully driven in (or the end of the slope passed) some calamity ought to follow.<br /><br />In either figure of speech, there are three components:<br /><ol><li>A small movement in a dangerous or negative direction (an implicit instability; the thin edge)<br /></li><li>A near-unstoppable  force in that same direction (lubricated gravity; the implicit hammer)<br /></li><li>A highly dangerous or negative result (crashing at the bottom of the slope; splitting whatever the wedge is in)</li></ol>It&#8217;s well worth being conscious of each of these components when you use these metaphors. Some examples to consider, many of which are taken from actual arguments:<br /><ul><li>Mandatory Internet filtering</li><li>Allowing papists in the Royal Navy</li><li>Abandoning the Lord&#8217;s Prayer in Parliament</li><li>Using the proprietary software present in the firmware of a hotel elevator</li><li>Giving money to a beggar</li><li>Nationalizing banks</li><li>Not shaving tomorrow<br /></li></ul></div>

I kinda like to think of the slippery slope ending some great gaping chasm.<br /><br />Either way, calamity awaits.</div>

At my parents&#39; house there were large french windows that were basically sheet glass and as a child I both ran into them when I thought they were open (fortunately they were very solid shop-window glass) and, probably more entertaining for spectators, tried to lean on them when I thought they were shut.</div>

Bice, it was completely transparent. Nigh invisible.<br /><br />Mary, yes, it was entirely shattered. We had to replace it immediately since shards of glass sticking out from doorframes are not conducive to household peace of mind.<br /><br />And I honestly did walk into it. No unusual force at all.</div>

I remember this was a big thing when I was a kid, hearing about other kids who had run into/through glass windows and doors.<br /><br />So you walked into it hard enough to smash it?</div>

After dispatching my missive on the ethereal winds, I must confess I had little hope. Although my faith in my readers is incalculable, my wanderings have taken me far, and I had begun to believe that I had seen all that has been given to mortal eye to see, and that my readers would be merely recounting tales already well known to me.<br /><br />But sing a new song, O doubting heart! Through a variety of means &#8211; some humble, some ingenious &#8211; you dear readers have sent word of old books for which the dust of age only strengthens the potency of the enchantments within, like some secret wine. I&#8217;ve heard of other books too, newer perhaps, their charms accordingly more fallible but perhaps not more feeble.<br /><br />Two books were commended to me, and two names without books commended also. That the numbering of the books matched the numbering of the names seemed auspicious to me. Of the books, the first is called &#8220;The Book of the New Sun&#8221; as written by Gene Wolfe; the second hight &#8220;The Gift&#8221; by Alison Croggan, an author from my own country. My hopes for the first are high, for the second, low. Though a prophet is seldom honored in his own town, my bigoted heart says an author is perhaps too honored in her own country.<br /><br />Two names without books were given. Though there are books to the names, the names were given to me without books and without books they shall be passed on. The names are Charles de Lint and George Macdonald. The second name was given to me by someone who has not read any of my missives, but who has certainly read me.<br /><br />I have found some of these tomes, and in due course I shall venture into them. Even when all are read and gone, my quest will not be over. Your help, dear reader, is needed now more than ever. I await your reply with eagerness and indeed, hope.<br /><br />I am etc.,</div>

I read a Charles de Lint (<i>The Little Country</i>, maybe?) when I was about 14, and I remember quite liking it.  I don&#39;t entirely trust my 14-year-old self&#39;s sense of taste, though&#8230;<br /><br />(Random fact: around about that time I was also reading quite a lot of Anne McCaffery, mainly the Dragonriders of Pern novels.)</div>
