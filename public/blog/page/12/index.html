This is both an ideal and a lie.</li><li>The contents of a garbage bin are not only the things that are meaningless to you they are also the things that are valueless. That is to say, the benefit of retaining them is less than the cost of the same.</li><li>This cost can be financial, spatial, psychological: upkeep; room; clutter.</li><li>We are perhaps best defined by the things that we discard.</li><li>A thing that is meaningless and valueless to everyone with access is true waste.</li><li>True waste cannot be destroyed, only created.

<a href="http://puzzling.org/logs/thoughts/2009/April/30/warhaft-and-manne">Great post</a> by <a href="http://mary.gardiner.id.au/">Mary Gardiner</a>; I&#8217;m disappointed that it needed to be said at all.<br /><br />Quoting here in full with Mary&#8217;s permission, since puzzling.org is under unusually heavy load.<br /><blockquote><h1>How to talk about Sally Warhaft and Robert Manne</h1><br /><p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk in various places about Sally Warhaft leaving her<br />position as editor of <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/tm/"><em>The Monthly</em></a>. I don&#8217;t have a novel substantive opinion on this: I&#8217;m a <em>The Monthly</em> subscriber (and I&#8217;ve therefore enjoyed Warhaft&#8217;s work), but not a writer or a left-wing socialite or a media insider. Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monthly#April_2009_editorial_change">a little summary</a> of the actual story. That said, I have a helpful guide to talking about Sally Warhaft and Robert Manne (or Morry Schwartz) in the same text.</p><ul><br /><li>If you refer to Robert Manne as &#8216;Manne&#8217;, then Sally Warhaft is referred to as &#8216;Warhaft&#8217;, not &#8216;Sally&#8217;, because otherwise you come across as treating Sally Warhaft as if she was an intimate of yours and Manne as a professional when you&#8217;re presumably wanting to comment on her professional editorial work.</li><br /><li>If you refer to Sally Warhaft as &#8216;Ms. Warhaft&#8217; then Robert Manne must be &#8216;Mr. Manne&#8217;, not just &#8216;Manne&#8217;. Otherwise it sounds like you&#8217;re making a big deal out of Warhaft being a woman, which doesn&#8217;t seem to be a factor in the story, and even if it was, that&#8217;s not the way to make that point.</li><br /><li>If you refer to Robert Manne with his academic title, &#8216;Professor Manne&#8217;, you should refer to Sally Warhaft with hers, &#8216;Doctor (or Dr) Warhaft&#8217;. I can at least squint and see the argument for this one: Manne has an academic position and Warhaft doesn&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s not as though her <em>The Monthly</em> position is totally divorced from her academic background either.</li><br /><li>If you&#8217;re going to comment on Sally Warhaft&#8217;s physical presence, say, by coming out with something like <q><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25402313-7582,00.html">she&#8217;s a whip-smart, willowy beauty, which makes her a great front for a lively mag</a>,</q> then here&#8217;s your line for Robert Manne: <q><a href="http://identi.ca/notice/3819127">he&#8217;s a whip-smart, potent steed, which makes him a great front for a lively magazine</a>.</q></li></ul></blockquote></div>

I do a fair bit of long-haul air travel. I&#8217;d like to get a decent pair of headphones or earphones or whatever that I can use on the plane.<br /><br />Desirable features:<br /><ul><li>Small (I&#8217;m traveling)<br /></li><li>Robust (<span style="font-style: italic;">I&#8217;m</span> traveling)</li><li>Block out or cancel noise (I&#8217;m traveling <span style="font-style: italic;">economy</span>)</li><li>Comfortable (I&#8217;m traveling economy for about thirty hours door-to-door)</li><li>Work without power source (thirty hours, dammit)</li><li>Plug into those two-prong things they have in planes<br /></li><li>Can be used as a skype headset (this is a bit of a long shot)</li></ul>Any recommendations?</div>

I previously had some Phillips (?) active noise cancelling headphones, but broke them through fitting them in to a carry-on-sized backpack with my other stuff.  They were ok.  Active noise cancellation is certainly a neat trick.<br /><br />Until recently I had some Shure in-ear phones: basically like foam earplugs but with speakers in them.  They have some substantial advantages: they&#8217;re much smaller and lighter, therefore easier to pack without breaking, they don&#8217;t need batteries and cannot run flat, and they arguably sound better.  <br /><br />The noise suppression, being passive, can&#8217;t be turned off so if you use them in an office you won&#8217;t hear voices clearly, which may be either good or bad at different times.  You can leave one of them out as a workaround.<br /><br />They work reasonably well under a motorcycle helmet depending on the space around the ears, though that&#8217;s presumably not an issue for you.  However the flappy cord is annoying, and on my next long trip I&#8217;ll probably try regular plugs plus a bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />If I was going to get earphones again I&#8217;d probably try the Etymotic ER6i.<br /><br />I would also recommend bringing an in-line volume control (~$5), because the in-seat AV source is at a very high level and too loud to listen to with most headphones.</div>

My previous headphones had a physical break last sprint (since repaired) so had a &#8220;ZOMG need headphones&#8221; moment for the trip home.<BR/>Options at Heathrow T4 being limited :-/ picked up some <A HREF="http://www.bose.com.au/site/index.aspx?path=products&ctrl=PG&pfid=10&pgid=32" REL="nofollow">Bose Quiet Comfort 2</A> headphones.<BR/>Not small, but not too bad. Moderately robust - they came with a hardish travel case, and the cups rotate to be flat.<BR/>Plug is removable - so you can sleep with them on - tried and tested. Which also answers the comfort option. :-)<BR/>You can buy those two prong plugs for $5 at DSE - tho istr, I only needed one for the trip out, not back.<BR/>They do significantly reduce (vs eliminate) engine noise, can still hear PA announcements.<BR/>AAA battery powered - lasted the entire trip back (35ish hours) for me and then some.<BR/>And I just discovered that they have a mic option - which I&#8217;m just about to order. Hopefully will arrive in time for my next thumper &#8220;quick call?&#8221; ;-)<BR/><BR/>hth!</div>

There are so many difficult things in the world: saying sorry, bring peace to the Middle East, adapting books to the big screen, accurately modeling turbulent fluids, wearing orange - I could go on forever.<br /><br />Living in a world full of such difficulties, it&#8217;s nice to know that there&#8217;s the occasional, useful accomplishment that&#8217;s within anyones reach. I speak primarily of making a chocolate thick shake.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a straightforward drink, elegant in its rich simplicity. To make it, you add chocolate and ice cream to milk and blend thoroughly. You need to be sure that it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">chocolate</span> (add chocolate), that it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">thick</span> (add ice cream), and that it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">shaken</span> (blend thoroughly).<br /><br />Sad to say, even this refuge of culinary ease has its perils. In my wide experience, I&#8217;ve noticed the following:<br /><ul><li>Not chocolate. The give away here is the pale colour, vanilla taste and complete lack of chocolate. Remedy: add chocolate.</li><li>Not thick. A thick shake that&#8217;s not thick is flavoured milk. Remedy: add ice cream.</li><li>Not shaken. Flavoured milk with unsuckable lumps of ice cream in it. Remedy: blend thoroughly.</li></ul>With diligence, application and a rigorous obedience to the simple principles outlined above, you too can make chocolate thick shakes of excellence.</div>
