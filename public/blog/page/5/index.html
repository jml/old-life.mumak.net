<br />(Skip to the bottom for a tl;dr summary)<br /><br />I read a lot. &nbsp;Reading has always been one of the chief pleasures in my life,&nbsp;and anyone who has spent more than a half hour with me knows that I also rather enjoy talking about what I read.<br /><br />In 2012, inspired by my friends Benny Walter &amp; Jean-Paul Calderone, and my old mentor&nbsp;Martin Chance, I&#8217;ve tried to keep a reading journal. I&#8217;ve kept this journal by&nbsp;inflicting the books I&#8217;ve read on the readers of this blog. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve gone through my posts on this blog, and some other notes about books I haven&#8217;t blogged here, and it turns out that I read sixty-five books in 2012. That is an awful lot of reading, and I think deserves a summary post.<br /><br />What I&#8217;d like to&nbsp;do now is recommend one fiction and one non-fiction book that I&#8217;ve read last&nbsp;year, and call out a few trends in my reading.<br /><h2>Top fiction</h2>I&#8217;ve read so much last year, and if I can take anything away it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s&nbsp;<i>so much</i> that can be done with the written word. &nbsp;My most recent reads,&nbsp;<i>Rivers of London</i>&nbsp;(Ben Aaronovitch) and <i>Invisible Cities</i>&nbsp;(Italo Calvino),&nbsp;brought this home to me. &nbsp;The former is a competently written, fun urban&nbsp;fantasy / police procedural set in London, the second a series of meditations&nbsp;on imagined cities. &nbsp;They are nothing alike, except that they are written and<br />made-up and brought me delight.<br /><br />This makes picking one thing basically impossible. &nbsp;After all, some books go better with&nbsp;some moods. &nbsp;<i>Redshirts</i> (John Scalzi) requires little brain to enjoy, despite&nbsp;being an intelligent book. &nbsp;<i>Peace</i>&nbsp;(Gene Wolfe) on the other hand, is&nbsp;actively out to get you. &nbsp;I found <i>Silas Marner</i>&nbsp;(George Eliot) morally and spiritually&nbsp;challenging, while <i>Gaudy Night</i>&nbsp; (Dorothy Sayers)&nbsp;gave me a few warm, comfortable moments of pretending to&nbsp;have had the Oxford education I always wanted. <br /><br />But, I want to&nbsp;pick just one book. &nbsp;At this point, it&#8217;s a matter of both pride and&nbsp;practicality. &nbsp;I really will go on forever if I don&#8217;t pick something.<br /><br />Ready? Good. &nbsp;Here it is: <i>Gawain and The Green Knight, </i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage.<br /><br /><i>Gawain</i>&nbsp;is an old English poem by an anonymous author. Armitage&#8217;s translation keeps to the&nbsp;alliterative structure of Saxon verse, but uses modern English. &nbsp;Although I&#8217;d&nbsp;read another translation of the poem before, I had never really &#8220;got it&#8221;.&nbsp;Attempts to make great works more accessible can often end with the many&nbsp;excellences of the original being lost. Armitage does just the opposite: he&nbsp;opened <i>Gawain</i> up to me and helped me see what all the fuss is about. &nbsp;Also,&nbsp;it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure to read aloud, has a fun story, and is short. &nbsp;What&nbsp;more could you possibly want?<br /><br />Close runners up include <i>David Copperfield</i> (I figured you&#8217;d already heard of&nbsp;it), <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>&nbsp;(great, but a little too much the kind of book&nbsp;that you read in high school English classes for me to recommend it as <i>the</i>&nbsp;book), <i>The Graveyard Book</i>&nbsp;(perfect, but a children&#8217;s book), and <i>The Fifth&nbsp;Head of Cerberus</i>&nbsp;(disqualified because it&#8217;s a re-read, and because I&#8217;ve&nbsp;yammered enough about Gene Wolfe).<br /><h2>Top non-fiction</h2>In contrast to picking my top novel, this one is easy. &nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel is short, well-written, and on a matter of interest to&nbsp;anyone reading this blog: how the things in our society are changed by being&nbsp;traded in markets.<br /><br />Reading the book challenged my generally positive attitude to free market capitalism and has left me with a more nuanced view. Also, in his carefully&nbsp;defined notion of &#8220;corruption&#8221;, Sandel has given me a new tool for thinking&nbsp;about all sorts of things.<br /><br />Close runners-up include <i>Debt</i>&nbsp;by David Graeber (fascinating explosion ideas&nbsp;that suffer from lack of organization) and <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>&nbsp;by Daniel&nbsp;Kahneman, which would have won, save that the ideas in <i>Thinking</i>&nbsp;were more&nbsp;familiar to me than the ideas in <i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>.<br /><h2>Trends</h2><h3>Kanban</h3>This year I&#8217;ve been applying kanban techniques to my reading. &nbsp;In a nutshell,&nbsp;I limit the number of books I read at once (max 4), and have a very limited&nbsp;selection of books selected to read next (max 9). &nbsp;The &#8220;In Progress&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;Next&#8221; books are very visible.<br /><br />It means I&#8217;m always finishing books, which is a nice feeling. &nbsp;It also means&nbsp;fewer books on the go at once, which in turn means that I can focus better on&nbsp;the books I&#8217;m reading, and feel less guilty about the books I&#8217;m not reading.<br /><br />It also means that when I get a recommendation, I don&#8217;t have to put it at the&nbsp;bottom of a pile, but can make a decision and actually stand a chance of&nbsp;reading it in the next six months.<br /><br />This is very much a nerdy thing to do, but that&#8217;s how I roll.<br /><br /><b>Books with exercises</b><br /><br />I&#8217;ve tried to do more study this year, especially on things that will help my&nbsp;professional development. &nbsp;This has meant reading books that have exercises. They have been&nbsp;rewarding, but they take <i>ages</i>&nbsp;to get through. &nbsp;The kanban system makes&nbsp;it really obvious.<br /><br />Further, I often need to read them at a computer, in a certain state of mind&nbsp;and with a high chance of not being interrupted for an hour or so. &nbsp;That&#8217;s&nbsp;pretty rare.<br /><br /><b>Short stories</b><br /><br />Back when I primarily read paperbacks, I would only very rarely go to a book&nbsp;store and by an anthology of short stories. &nbsp;Now that I use an eBook reader, I&nbsp;read many, many more short stories than I used to.<br /><br />I didn&#8217;t expect that, although perhaps I should have. &nbsp;Since I always carry&nbsp;around an ebook reader around, I have much more choice about what to read. &nbsp;I&nbsp;also keep at least one collection of short stories on my phone, in case I&#8217;m&nbsp;stuck without my Kindle.<br /><br />This means that there are plenty more <i>opportunities</i> to read short stories,&nbsp;which seems to mean I read more. &nbsp;This in turn means I get to discover new&nbsp;authors.<br /><h3>Blogging and logging</h3>I&#8217;m not very satisfied with dumping lists of books on my blog. &nbsp;I&#8217;m also&nbsp;unhappy with the reviews I&#8217;ve written, which so rarely do justice to my own&nbsp;opinions and feelings, let alone the books themselves.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to be able to log when I start reading a book, when I finish it, and&nbsp;whether I actually finished it or just gave up. &nbsp;I&#8217;d like to be able to look&nbsp;over books I&#8217;ve read recently and see what genres I&#8217;ve been reading from. &nbsp;I&#8217;d&nbsp;like to do this on something that&#8217;s not a social website. &nbsp;(Do you think I&nbsp;read to be social?)<br /><h2>Overall</h2>I&#8217;m blessed to be able to read and enjoy so many books. &nbsp;As I said earlier, 65&nbsp;books is a lot, and I can&#8217;t help but wonder at what I could have done if I had&nbsp;only read thirty books.<br /><h2>tl;dr</h2><div><br /><ul><li>I read 65+ books in 2012</li><li>Top fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>Gawain and The Green Knight,&nbsp;</i>translated&nbsp;by Simon Armitage</li><li>Top non-fiction pick:&nbsp;<i>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</i>&nbsp;by Michael Sandel</li></ul></div></div>

<div>Jolie and I are both keen readers and have both collected quite a few books during our years apart. Every shelf is covered in books, and practically every flat surface has at least one book on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, since we moved in to this place last April/May, I&#8217;ve been annoyed by the lack of order to our book collection. When we arrived, we just took books out of boxes and shoved them into the nearest shelf with a gap. I&#8217;ve been threatening to organize them all for some time now, but &#8230; well, there&#8217;s almost always something more interesting, important or urgent to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>It&#8217;s annoying because there&#8217;s a silly way in which my books form a part of my identity. It&#8217;s silly for so many reasons.&nbsp;I haven&#8217;t curated my own book collection very carefully. If I look at the books there I can tell there are many formative books in my own experience that are missing, and that there&#8217;s a lot of mostly harmless entertaining junk. I wouldn&#8217;t want someone drawing conclusions about me from my bookshelf.</div><div><br /></div><div>And yet they are the possessions that I value most, and the ones that I&#8217;ve kept with me through many moves and many years. A friend of mine, commenting on a difficult move to another city said, &#8220;Home is where your stuff is&#8221;, that having your belongings around makes you feel like you belong.</div><div><br /></div>Anyway, yesterday I came down with a cold. I don&#8217;t know how it is for you, but whenever I get a cold I alternate between langour and manic fits of dizzy, half-crazed buzzing. There&#8217;s not &nbsp; enough focus to channel it into useful hacking or study, but it&#8217;s great for doing menial tasks.<div><br /></div><div>So today I&#8217;ve used a couple of spare hours to get the poetry, plays and fiction separated from the rest of the books and sorted alphabetically by author. I can&#8217;t tell you how good it feels to look at them all lined up in order.</div><div><br /></div><div>One pleasant outcome is that it made it really easy to identify the books that we both own. We both know our taste in fiction overlaps quite a bit, but how does that manifest itself in our library? Well, now we know:</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GDBXqEwQ6B0/ULuQD6OSZYI/AAAAAAAAAkg/lwQErR5anZU/s1600/dupe-books.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GDBXqEwQ6B0/ULuQD6OSZYI/AAAAAAAAAkg/lwQErR5anZU/s400/dupe-books.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Our duplicate books</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>Here&#8217;s what they were:</div><div><ul><li><i>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</i>, Douglas Adams</li><li><i>The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>, John Bunyan</li><li><i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</i>, Susanna Clarke</li><li><i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, Philip K.

<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I dumped my &#8220;things read&#8221; since August in my <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2012/11/books-books-books.html">previous post</a>. &nbsp;Here are some thoughts about them.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Apocalypse Codex</span></i><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;">Lots of fun. Little brain required. Clearly did a fair chunk of research into what evangelical Christians actually believe &amp; how they speak (although I&#8217;ve never in my long-legged life heard someone say &#8220;pentecostalist&#8221;). Certain events seem to undermine premise of the series, but am confident that Stross can keep it going from here.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;"><br /></span><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; text-align: justify;">The Citadel of the Autarch</i></span><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Gene Wolfe is awesome and is smarter than you or I.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">David Copperfield</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I loved this book and was surprised by how much I loved it. People bang on about Dickens having way too much &#8220;description&#8221;, but I honestly have no idea what they are talking about. His problem, at least in this book, is that he occasionally takes a ten chapter break from the plot. He writes good people being happy very well. Uriah Heep is perhaps the best villain I&#8217;ve ever read in a novel.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>Frankenstein</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">No one complains about Mary Shelley having too much description, but half of this book is about Swiss mountains. &nbsp;More seriously, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Wish the protagonist whinged less.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>The Graveyard Book</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Fun Neil Gaiman fun. Am jealous of him.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>Hard Facts, &#8230;</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Essential reading if you are a manager or are in the world of business. Evidence-based management. No where near as boring as that sounds.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>Old Man&#8217;s War</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">First Scalzi I ever read, despite reading his blog for ages. Lots of fun pervaded by a bright, optimistic spirit (as opposed to the cynicism of Stross, say). Obvious homages to Heinlein. What&#8217;s the deal with American atheist authors quoting King James scripture, rather than a more modern translation?</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>Hollow Hills etc</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Merlin&#8217;s autobiography, followed by Mordred&#8217;s autobiography. People think <i>Dickens</i>&nbsp;has too much description? Really?! None of these books are &#8220;fun&#8221;, because the first person narrator is always a detached, aloof outsider who takes themselves rather seriously. Even so, I enjoyed the attempt to put the Arthurian mythos in a historical setting, and very much liked the way she had a wizard explain what is actually behind the legend. Patrick Rothfuss, take note.&nbsp;</span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;"><i>Redshirts</i></span></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Enjoyed this a little less than <i>OMW</i>&nbsp;actually, perhaps because I&#8217;ve never been a Star Trek fan. Still had great fun and got through it in two sittings.

Thanks for the recommendation. Will add Wives &amp; Daughters to the list.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t read Mansfield Park, although I definitely should. I&#39;ve read Pride &amp; Prejudice, Sense &amp; Sensibility, Emma, and Persuasion. In each of these, the character flaws seem much more obvious [sometimes in the title!] than either of the Eliot books I&#39;ve read, and the characters seem more static. <br /><br />Should also finish Vanity Fair one day.</div>

I should check blog comments more often. I should also check out Patrick O&#39;Brian. <br /><br />You may be right about Eliot and Austen. On the other hand I&#39;d just finished reading Mansfield Park and was thinking particularly of the little ways in which Sir Bertram failed his children. Although, when I try to describe the small failures of Sir Bertram they suddenly loom large and refuse to fit into my categories. I&#39;ll have to think some more about those distinctions.<br /><br />Since you seem to like this sort of thing y&#39;all might enjoy reading Wives and Daughters. It&#39;s a similarly pastoral sort of book and a thoroughly good read. If Vanity Fair has been described as a &quot;novel without a hero&quot; I really think that Wives and Daughters is it&#39;s counterpart in that it&#39;s a &quot;novel without a villain.&quot; The characters are flawed to various degrees but it&#39;s not as though there was a Wickham or Becky Sharp driving the action along. </div>

Oh, also, Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s Aubrey/Maturin books have often been described as &quot;Austen at sea&quot;. You might enjoy them.</div>

Very well said! I think you&#39;re right.<br /><br />Perhaps I&#39;d say Eliot more than Austen deals with the &quot;deceptively small actions&quot;.  When I think of Austen, I think of words, rather than actions. <br /><br />Eliot also seems to get something about character that Austen doesn&#39;t. That it forms and changes almost accidentally. In Austen sometimes all it seems to take to reform is reason and a crisis. I don&#39;t know, maybe that&#39;s wrong, but I think there&#39;s some fundamental &amp; important difference there. </div>

Silas Marner is a favorite of mine. It, along with much of Jane Austen, practically amounts to comfort food. It&#39;s hard to say why though. I suppose because Eliot and Austen are both brilliant at writing about ordinary lives and in a way that both affirms our dreams and heartbreaks and calls attention those deceptively small actions that make or mar our lives. They affirm the dignity of the mundane.</div>

<b>The Claw of the Conciliator (Gene Wolfe)</b><br />Gene Wolfe continues to be subtle, ambiguous, and intelligent. Enjoying more on re-reading, but it&#8217;s hard to stay alert enough. I wonder if my friends who like magical realism will ever read any of his books. I&#8217;m starting to believe it&#8217;s set in Argentina, in homage to Borges. I must read some Borges.<br /><br /><b>Debt: The First 5,000 Years (David Graeber)</b><br /><i>Really </i>interesting. Not sure exactly how true though. Wonderful firework show of ideas about debt, how it works, where money comes from, the link between violence and slavery. Difficult to summarize, partly because Graeber hasn&#8217;t done the work of making clear links between all of his ideas. Would like to write more about this later.<br /><br />There&#8217;s one bit where he talks about how things like weregild weren&#8217;t about saying &#8220;the life of your brother is worth two hundred shillings&#8221; or whatever, but rather an indication that the debt can never be repaid, pointing particularly to certain cultures where a bride price has to be paid for the groom&#8217;s entire life. At this point, he almost exactly replicates the logic in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV">Hebrews 10</a> about how the necessity of repeating the payments (Hebrews: sacrifices) shows that they can never actually re-pay the debt (Hebrews: cleanse sin).<br /><br /><b>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets (Michael Sandel)</b><br />Where <i>Debt</i>&nbsp;is sprawling, fascinating and though-provoking, this is precise, closely argued and convincing. Also, easy to summarize.<br /><br />Sandel says that markets are great, but we probably shouldn&#8217;t use them for everything. First, because of fairness. The more things can be bought and sold, the more having money, and indeed <i>not</i>&nbsp;having money,&nbsp;matters. Second, because for many things, trading them on the market changes what they are. If you could buy a Nobel prize, would you?<br /><br />He calls this second property of markets &#8220;corruption&#8221;. He doesn&#8217;t mean it to be a blanket negative. Perhaps it&#8217;s fine to allow the market to change some things. Maybe it is better, for example, to pay kids a couple of pounds for every book they read, and thus improve their reading abilities but perhaps completely sap any pleasure they might have had from the exercise. It&#8217;s a value judgement, he says.<br /><br />He goes on to say, I think, that perhaps part of the reason markets take over everything is because we increasingly shun genuine moral and spiritual discourse in the public sphere. People are expected to check their beliefs (religious or otherwise) at the door. It&#8217;s an interesting thought, and one I wish he explored further. However, to do so would have wrecked the beautiful simplicity of this book.<br /><br /><b>The Great Gatsby</b>&nbsp;<b>(F. Scott Fitzgerald)</b><br />Not sure why this one made it into the canon.<br /><br /><b>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels (Jonathan Swift)</b><br />As above. Often wished I had some sort of commentary to know exactly who or what he was satirising and why.<br /><br /><b>Pretotype It (Alberto Savoia)</b><br />Really good. Really short. <a href="http://www.pretotyping.org/pretotype-it---the-book">Read it now</a>. Will probably blog about it at <a href="http://code.mumak.net/">Mere Code</a>.<br /><br />Premise is that before you start out to make a product (&#8220;do a thing&#8221;) you should do something ridiculously cheap and easy to check to see if it&#8217;s the right thing.</div>

I&#8217;ve had several non-fiction burdens in my &#8220;currently reading&#8221; list that I&#8217;ve decided to drop. Farewell &#8220;ggplot2&#8221;, &#8220;Think Stats&#8221; and &#8220;Innovator&#8217;s Solution&#8221;. I won&#8217;t miss you. Maybe I&#8217;ll read you again when I care more urgently about data analysis and launching successful products. Still slogging through &#8220;7 Habits&#8221;.<br /><br />Have been working through the anthology, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Way-Wizard-ebook/dp/B004SI4BKA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054263&amp;sr=8-2">The Way of the Wizard</a>, which is fun for tube rides and has a few interesting stories. The ones by Martin, Gaiman, Silverberg and Le Guin stand out, which is probably what you&#8217;d expect.<br /><br />Jolie got me a bevy of books for my birthday. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peace-Gene-Wolfe/dp/0765334569/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054559&amp;sr=8-2">Peace</a> by Gene Wolfe straight through almost instantly. It&#8217;s great. It made me read<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifth-Head-Cerberus-S-F-Masterworks/dp/0575094222/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054492&amp;sr=8-1"> Fifth Head of Cerberus</a> again. Fifth Head, by the way, is great. Really great. An ambiguous, intelligent, multi-layered, irresolvable meditation on identity, individuality and post-colonialism with strong Kafka and Proust notes. Read it.<br /><br />I&#8217;m clearly on a bit of a Wolfe bender at the moment. I just consulted my records and it looks like I also re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shadow-Torturer-ebook/dp/B005HRT9TE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341054842&amp;sr=8-1">Shadow of the Torturer</a>. I picked up on a bunch of subtleties I missed last time.<br /><br />Turns out that I&#8217;m not a very visual reader. I don&#8217;t pick up details in descriptions and see them in my mind&#8217;s eye very well. If the same words get used, I&#8217;ll notice that. But a nebulous figure could be described as &#8220;fair-haired&#8221;, say, in one part of a book and then later as &#8220;blond&#8221;, and I might never actually guess that they were meant to be the same person. It&#8217;s why I&#8217;m rubbish at guessing the murderer in most crime novels.<br /><br />Wolfe often uses visual clues like that. So when re-reading Fifth Head or Shadow, I have been compelled to read more slowly, more carefully, paying attention to what is actually going on in the narrated world. A wonderful, new experience.<br /><br />Also read a Rumpole omnibus. Jolly good fun, a bit repetitious, suspect the TV show would be better.<br /><br />And since writing this post a couple of weeks ago, quite a few more!</div>

I&#39;m similar, I&#39;m almost totally incapable of visualising things. It&#39;s the same with memory. When friends were memorising vocab they&#39;d come up with really visual memory hooks but that never worked for me. I was much faster looking at the word and remembering what it looked/sounded like.</div>

When I started the year I had grand plans for my health and fitness. I don&#8217;t&nbsp;do New Years Resolutions, but the Christmas break is a great time to review my goals and to set new ones. Sadly, I&#8217;ve made barely any progress toward any of these goals, and in fact have regressed on some of them.<br /><br />If you don&#8217;t mind too much, I&#8217;d like to share the story with you. This isn&#8217;t so much by way of making excuses as getting things clear for me, and sorting out some kind of accountability.<br /><br />The first set-back was a&nbsp;wrist injury that happened pretty much as soon as I got back from Australia. It prevented me from kick-boxing for a couple of weeks and stopped me from starting any strength training. Perhaps for these reasons, I got fairly depressed in general, and started eating junk and drinking a little too much as a way of seeking comfort. Yuck.<br /><br />Once I got back from that I went straight into grading preparation mode for kick-boxing. Grading is physically exhausting, and demands heaps of energy, so I just shoved food into my mouth for four weeks, desperately trying to get enough calories. It&#8217;s also really stressful and time-consuming, so I didn&#8217;t start that strength training I wanted to.<br /><br />All this meant that I never got back on to my clean, pre-Christmas eating habits, nor my regular progress tracking. The latter is important, since it&#8217;s an early warning system and is very motivating.<br /><br />After the grading prep (and missing the actual grading day itself!), I dropped my kick-boxing training right back so as to help out more with wedding preparation and to find a place and move into the new flat where Joliette &amp; I live now. That was heaps of fun, but I didn&#8217;t take the opportunity to start new exercise habits, go back to tracking progress or clean up my eating. I think I went back on to drinking coffee at some point here.<br /><br />Moving house also got me stress eating again (way too much pizza), which kept up right on to the final stages of wedding preparation too. Although happily that last turned from stress eating into celebration eating as friends and family started to arrive.<br /><br />A couple of weeks before the wedding, I cracked a rib while sparring. That hurt a lot, and stopped me from doing any exercise. There&#8217;s not much you can do when it hurts to raise your arms over your head, or to twist your torso.<br /><br />And then on the honeymoon I spent a couple of blissful weeks doing nothing and eating everything.<br /><br />I really don&#8217;t want to make excuses. I didn&#8217;t choose to crack my rib or sprain my wrist, I could have chosen to respond to them better, and I certainly could have chosen to respond to the various stresses in my life in a different, healthier way.<br /><br />In the meantime, it&#8217;s been really inspiring to watch the progress of friends and colleagues (especially <a href="https://plus.google.com/118140811742423812280/posts">Sean</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/undacuvabrutha">Robbie</a>) who have been getting fitter.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve never really much liked the idea of sharing my progress before – it just seems to personal a thing. But since their example helped me, maybe I&#8217;ll figure something out.<br /><br />What&#8217;s next then? Well, I&#8217;m already eating better, am back at kick-boxing and Jolie is being very supportive. I&#8217;m going to look over my goals again and see what I can salvage. I might even make a bet or try to find someone to compete against in order to get a bit of extra motivation.<br /><br /></div>

Yeah, pretty much. We still eat grains, but not as much and mostly just the less refined stuff - brown rice etc. It&#39;s pretty similar in respect to the no sugar thing I think. I bought a no-sugar cookbook which was basically paleo. It&#39;s pretty crazy how much stuff sugar is in though (sausages, stock powder, savoury biscuits, sauces &amp; condiments&#8230; the list goes on) so that&#39;s changed a lot of what we eat and how we cook.  Our Weber BBQ has been getting a lot more use lately! (even in winter). Soooo tasty. I&#39;ve also made a new friend who is Chinese and a great cook. There haven&#39;t been any 12 course banquets yet&#8230; but we&#39;ve had a lot of deliciousness sent our way! <br /><br />:)</div>

Hey Bron!<br /><br />Diet-wise, I actually try to eat paleo / primal, as recommended by<br />http://www.marksdailyapple.com/, http://www.nerdfitness.com/ and http://jasonferruggia.com/.  They all very much strongly discourage most sugar (allowing small amounts of berries and the occasional sweet potato).<br /><br />One of the great consequences is that I go out of my way to eat more vegetables.<br /><br />Is what you&#39;re doing with the sugar-free thing?<br /><br />In any case, I&#39;m back to eating that way (modulo the occasional 12 course Chinese banquet), and I feel great.</div>

Congratulations! :) It was lovely to see the happy photos of you both on the special day.<br /><br />I felt bad about jumping in and adding more advice, so I&#39;ve waited a few weeks before writing this. But I still reckon it&#39;s relevant&#8230; and, you know, I can&#39;t help myself if I think I can be helpful! But firstly, let me just say how enjoyable it was to read your very well written post.<br /><br />So, I wanted to recommend a book that&#39;s completely changed the way we eat (since Feb). It&#39;s called Sweet Poison, by David Gillespie (actually I read his second book the Sweet Poison Quit Plan which summarizes the science simply and is more practical).<br /><br />The elevator pitch is this: sugar (fructose/sucrose) is addictive, it&#39;s in everything (not just sweet stuff) and it affects our natural appetite control. Withdraw from sugar and suddenly eating healthy is easy, stress, mood and sleep may improve and almost everyone whose done it has lost weight without even trying.<br /><br />Most of my friends think I&#39;m nuts (except 2 who have tried it and love it). But since Feb this has become the new normal for us and both Nick and I reckon we&#39;ll never go back.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck with the training. Let me know if you do want any more info. And again, congratulations to you both.</div>

This is very much a &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; recommendation, but, I think your main priority should be to manage the stress.<br /><br />Willpower is an exhaustible resource, and this chronology of failure sounds like you just ran out at some point (between broken bones and wedding preparations it&#39;s no wonder).  Stress erodes the will, so, rather than attempting to compensate with more willpower, try to manage the stress at its source (which is to say, your mind, not the environment that produces stress).<br /><br />A lot of folks recommend mindfulness meditation.  That didn&#39;t seem to work too well for me, as I haven&#39;t gotten myself together to actually do it regularly, but then, I don&#39;t have the wherewithal to drag myself to kickboxing practice either, so perhaps you&#39;ll have better luck with that.</div>

I have to agree with you about it being a personal thing. I started focusing on weight loss back in March, and it has actually been going very well (strong on 1kg/week consistently). I haven&#39;t really shared it, though I can see the point of it being encouraging to others.<br /><br />I have to say recording what I eat was really what made it happen for me. That and premade salads that make it as easy for me to have a salad rather than a sandwich for lunch.</div>

Because I&#8217;m too lazy to figure out how to do a proper reading journal, I&#8217;m going to continue to inflict my recent reading on you all.<br /><br />I took a break from the business books that I am supposed to be reading and got into some proper holiday fiction.<br /><ul><li><i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</i>, Laurence Sterne</li><li><i>The Psychopath Test</i>, Jon Ronson</li><li><i>Un Lun Dun</i>, China Miéville</li><li><i>Have His Carcase</i>, Dorothy L. Sayers</li><li><i>Ready Player One</i>, Ernest Cline</li><li><i>Hangman&#8217;s Holiday</i>, Dorothy L. Sayers</li></ul><div><i>Tristram Shandy</i>&nbsp;soars above the rest of these. I started reading it just as wedding prep got ridiculously stressful. It&#8217;s pleasant, wafting absurdity was such a welcome escape from logistics, phone calls and bills. I was surprised by how modern it was too. It&#8217;s as if one is watching a scene in some 18th century English country house, and then Eric Idle pops in wearing an all-white morning suit and starts crooning away.<br /><br />It&#8217;s similar in place to <i>Tom Jones</i>, mostly in how it has a fair bit of bawdy humour and also not a few addresses to critics. I&#8217;m guessing both are functions of the time.<br /><br />Happily, <i>Have His Carcase </i>refers to <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. It&#8217;s one of the more mysterious of Sayers&#8217;s mysteries, and a lot of fun. It is very hard not to like Lord Peter Wimsey. He turns up in the short stories in <i>Hangman&#8217;s Holiday </i>too.<br /><br /><i>Un Lun Dun </i>is the first China Miéville book I&#8217;ve started reading and not immediately hurled at a nearby wall. It&#8217;s a kids book (not even a &#8220;young adult&#8221; book), but is fun for all that. <i>Ready Player One</i>&nbsp;is mindless, harmless escapism. It could have done with slightly less geeky wish fulfilment though: at one point, the protagonist is literally playing video games all day, except for when he is using his elite hacker skills to get buff.<br /><br /><i>The Psychopath Test</i>&nbsp;is typical journalist non-fiction.<br /><br />Currently working through some more anthologies of short stories. Now that I&#8217;m back from holiday will try to get stuck into my non-fiction books again.</div><div><br /></div></div>
