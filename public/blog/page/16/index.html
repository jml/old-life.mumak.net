I was toying around with an idea for a short fantasy-genre story called &#8220;A guy with a sword&#8221; last night and thinking about how (if at all) it should be influenced by my own Australian nature.<br /><br />But then I was thinking, have swords ever been a big deal here? Are there any records of men dueling each other from the early days of the colony? In fact, has anyone in Australia ever been killed with an actual sword?</div>

As far as I know swords were common in the gentry way-back-when, but for little more than ornamental purposes.<BR/><BR/>It was common for certain military ranks to wear swords as part of formal dress, but certainly not for combat.</div>

There was the rather famous incident with Francis de Groot at the opening of the Harbour Bridge. No people were injured, but there was a sword prominently involved.</div>

I&#8217;ve had a cold this week and I&#8217;m getting the cough I get after I get colds of this kind. My right arm feels like it has been twisted backwards in my right arm socket. The days are getting warmer and muggier and the nights aren&#8217;t cold enough to let me sleep.<br /><br />But that&#8217;s all ripples on the surface. Beneath the churn is an ocean that&#8217;s unaffected. I&#8217;d say a calm ocean, but that would be lying. If we had to stretch the metaphor further (and I feel we must), then I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s at least some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> going on down there.<br /><br />Reflecting on a year in Sydney, I realize that the words spoken by all my friends last year were true. It is a big place that&#8217;s hard to get around. It is difficult to make friends here, even in church. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what this means for next year.<br /><br />In other news, I&#8217;ve finished reading <i>The Illuminatus! Trilogy</i>. I like it a lot, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that it&#8217;s a shallower knock-off of <i>Infinite Jest</i>, even if it was published twenty years before it.</div>

So, the idea behind the page 56 thing is to get the book <span style="font-style: italic;">nearest</span> you, not the smartest one or the one you&#8217;re reading or the one with the best line. That&#8217;s what &#8211; oh my, a car crash &#8211; <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2008/11/page-56.html">my last post</a> was about. Still, I came across this in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</span> last night, and thought you might be interested:<br /><br /><blockquote>Besides, he had already formed his own theory about Fernando Poo: he was convinced that BUGGER&#8211;Blowhard&#8217;s Unreformed Gangsters, Goons, and Espionage Renegades, an international conspiracy of criminals and double agents, led by the infamous and mysterious Eric &#8220;the Red&#8221; Blowhard&#8211;was behind it all.</blockquote><br /><br />&#8220;He&#8221; is 00005, a British secret agent. As best as I can tell so far, he&#8217;s a fairly minor character. Seen <span style="font-style:italic;">Quantum of Solace</span> yet? What did you think?</div>

The fact that you are wondering if a character is minor or not in the Illuminatus Trilogy suggests that you might not quite have got how this book works (or otherwise) yet&#8230;</div>

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about getting myself an iPhone. Of course, Telstra is an ass, so I&#8217;d have to spend almost a thousand dollars to get out of my current contract &#8211; Apple can wait. <br /><br />Read <i>Lord of Light</i> again recently; it&#8217;s a great book and you should too, if you can. Started on <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>. Speaking of the Illuminati (which I rarely do out loud, hidden watchers you see), they are making a film out of Dan Brown&#8217;s <i>Angels and Demons</i>. I guess it shouldn&#8217;t surprise me since the first one was hilarious &#8211; &#8220;just the way the pagans would have wanted&#8221;.<br /><br />I kind of had to read <i>Lord of Light</i>, since the book I read before that was <i>The Broken Sword</i> by Poul Anderson. Well above average fantasy, of the kind you can&#8217;t make any more because of <big><b>Tolkien</b></big>. You can&#8217;t switch from stylized Nordic fantasy filled with Saxon verse straight to <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>, hence the Zelazny.<br /><br />Incidentally, due to cirumstances, I now believe that <i>Infinite Jest</i> uses the phrase &#8220;immantentizing the Eschaton&#8221;. This belief feels erroneous, but it&#8217;s there like an ill-fitting jacket that you can&#8217;t get rid of since you need something to keep you warm and you can&#8217;t bear the pressure of having to choose another one.<br /><br />Lindfield is boring me a lot. That and circumstances (different from the <i>IJ</i>-possiby-erroneous-belief-inducing ones) will probably mean I&#8217;ll be moving again. I hate moving. If you hear about a place to move to, let me know. Ideally it would be a share house with interesting and friendly people at roughly my age group.<br /><br />I&#8217;m really looking forward to Christmas. I&#8217;m sick of 2008 and am willing to take my chances with a different year. Summer too.</div>

Blogging vs doing presentations jml? ;-)<BR/><BR/>&#8216;Lord of Light&#8217; rang the highly vague bell. &#8216;Zelanzy&#8217; clicked.<BR/><BR/>*Very* odd book IMHO. I enjoyed it, but haven&#8217;t rushed to re-read. I found it &#8230; heavy going. I prefer a lighter read. I suspect the work separation thing :-)<BR/><BR/>Would explain why my Pratchett collection is almost in tatters.</div>

A couple of people have approached me privately, encouraging me to continue writing this blog. I&#8217;m touched by these sentiments, right down to the very pits of my undernourished heart.<br /><br />However, if you feel that this blog has made your day that little bit brighter, might I suggest you express your gratitude in more concrete terms. To wit, send me a tub of <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2008/03/candied_bacon_i_1.html">candied bacon ice cream</a>.<br /><br />You know you want to.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size:85%;">(Actually guys, you have no idea how much your feedback and comments mean to me.

I like your blog because I like reading things people have to say, and it&#8217;s different to talking because if you were ranting on about something I totally disagreed with or didn&#8217;t care about I&#8217;d have to feel awkward or be rude, whereas if I&#8217;m reading I can just skip bits :p<BR/>I like blogs. I just wish there was a way to combine LJ and blogger so I could read ALL my friends updates - because I have an LJ I only hear about my three friends who are on that, and I have to check other people&#8217;s by remembering, so I&#8217;ll probably only read it for a month or so :(<BR/>Keep putting reminders on facebook :)</div>

I&#8217;m OK with science fiction. A lot of it is terribly written, but on the whole I accept the genre.<br /><br />That said, the kind I like best isn&#8217;t really science fiction, it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">economics fiction</span>, fiction that addresses what the world would be like if the rules of scarcity changed. Books like:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Dispossessed</span>, Ursula Le Guin (the best SF author ever. If you disagree, you are wrong.)</li><li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Culture</span> novels, Iain M. Banks</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Diamond Age</span>, Neal Stephenson (to a certain extent)</li></ul>In most of these stories, societies solve the &#8220;limited supply, unlimited demand&#8221; problem by inventing technology which provides an unlimited supply. Hence, they become &#8220;science&#8221; fiction.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also a short story by Lord Dunsany called &#8220;The Bureau d&#8217;Echanges de Maux&#8221; which describes a market where evils, rather than goods, can be traded. Of course, Dunsany doesn&#8217;t care about whether this market performs a useful economic function, so there&#8217;s still areas to explore.</div>

You may have seen the ads from our benevolent Government, telling us that we need to lose weight, trim down and start feeling better so we don&#8217;t crush our public health system under megatonnes of raw lard.<br /><br />You may have even gone to <a href="http://www.measureup.gov.au/internet/abhi/publishing.nsf">their website</a>, where you&#8217;ll find this wonderful gem:<br /><blockquote>The waist measurements above are recommended for Caucasian men, and Caucasian and Asian women. Recommended waist measurements are yet to be determined for all ethnic groups. It is believed that they may be lower for Asian men. They are also likely to be higher for Pacific Islanders and African Americans (men and women).</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>&#8220;African Americans&#8221;? Do black immigrants from the United States really make up that large a percentage of our population, or did the government just mean &#8220;people of African descent&#8221;?<br /><br />To me, it sounds as if someone indulged in <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit">mindless political correctness</a>. Please try harder.<br /><blockquote></blockquote></div>

So I&#8217;m sure I heard something the other day about fat people in Canada or something having a right to two plane seats for the price of one. Fair enough, I&#8217;m sure flying must be intensely uncomfortable for obese people, it&#8217;s bad enough for tall people.<BR/>However, I think if they&#8217;re going to have rules like that then people like me should either get cheaper tickets or automatically doubled baggage allowance. It&#8217;s only fair. Otherwise why SHOULDN&#8217;T I live on cheeseburgers? Won&#8217;t cost me any more to get around&#8230;<BR/>Damnit, if you want people to lose weight, give incentives to small people, not generosity to big people!</div>

Sure enough, looking all over the net I find quite a lot of different guesstimates of chronic illness risk. Oddly, the ones that talk about waist measurement alone generally have much higher figures than the Aus govt. one (ie, 37 inches, 93cm for women) and various others suggesting that yes, it perhaps may vary with height eg http://calorielab.com/news/2005/06/07/waist-to-height-ratio-best-health-predictor/<BR/><BR/>So as usual with rule of thumb public health metrics, who the hell knows?</div>

This one is notoriously common in online fandom when North Americans write about fictional black characters living in Europe, or even in Africa.<BR/><BR/>I think something slightly more subtle may be going on here: that the health studies they are relying on come from the United States. I have actually looked at some and believe they may use &#8220;African American&#8221; partly to make it clear what their population is: it&#8217;s people living in the United States. It&#8217;s not a given that that data can be extrapolated to all people of black African descent. (In fact, I would guess it&#8217;s unlikely, given the genetic diversity in Africans.)<BR/><BR/>However, this isn&#8217;t wholly consistent: they don&#8217;t make a similar point for Asians or for Caucasians for that matter.<BR/><BR/>I would guess the information is authored by an American writer and not completely edited for local appropriateness (as opposed to it being authored by an Australian).<BR/><BR/>I am curious about why the recommendations do not vary with height, myself. Do people of all heights and builds really have exactly the same waistline risks?</div>
