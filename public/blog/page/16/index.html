So, the idea behind the page 56 thing is to get the book <span style="font-style: italic;">nearest</span> you, not the smartest one or the one you&#8217;re reading or the one with the best line. That&#8217;s what &#8211; oh my, a car crash &#8211; <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2008/11/page-56.html">my last post</a> was about. Still, I came across this in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</span> last night, and thought you might be interested:<br /><br /><blockquote>Besides, he had already formed his own theory about Fernando Poo: he was convinced that BUGGER&#8211;Blowhard&#8217;s Unreformed Gangsters, Goons, and Espionage Renegades, an international conspiracy of criminals and double agents, led by the infamous and mysterious Eric &#8220;the Red&#8221; Blowhard&#8211;was behind it all.</blockquote><br /><br />&#8220;He&#8221; is 00005, a British secret agent. As best as I can tell so far, he&#8217;s a fairly minor character. Seen <span style="font-style:italic;">Quantum of Solace</span> yet? What did you think?</div>

The fact that you are wondering if a character is minor or not in the Illuminatus Trilogy suggests that you might not quite have got how this book works (or otherwise) yet&#8230;</div>

I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about getting myself an iPhone. Of course, Telstra is an ass, so I&#8217;d have to spend almost a thousand dollars to get out of my current contract &#8211; Apple can wait. <br /><br />Read <i>Lord of Light</i> again recently; it&#8217;s a great book and you should too, if you can. Started on <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>. Speaking of the Illuminati (which I rarely do out loud, hidden watchers you see), they are making a film out of Dan Brown&#8217;s <i>Angels and Demons</i>. I guess it shouldn&#8217;t surprise me since the first one was hilarious &#8211; &#8220;just the way the pagans would have wanted&#8221;.<br /><br />I kind of had to read <i>Lord of Light</i>, since the book I read before that was <i>The Broken Sword</i> by Poul Anderson. Well above average fantasy, of the kind you can&#8217;t make any more because of <big><b>Tolkien</b></big>. You can&#8217;t switch from stylized Nordic fantasy filled with Saxon verse straight to <i>The Illuminatus Trilogy</i>, hence the Zelazny.<br /><br />Incidentally, due to cirumstances, I now believe that <i>Infinite Jest</i> uses the phrase &#8220;immantentizing the Eschaton&#8221;. This belief feels erroneous, but it&#8217;s there like an ill-fitting jacket that you can&#8217;t get rid of since you need something to keep you warm and you can&#8217;t bear the pressure of having to choose another one.<br /><br />Lindfield is boring me a lot. That and circumstances (different from the <i>IJ</i>-possiby-erroneous-belief-inducing ones) will probably mean I&#8217;ll be moving again. I hate moving. If you hear about a place to move to, let me know. Ideally it would be a share house with interesting and friendly people at roughly my age group.<br /><br />I&#8217;m really looking forward to Christmas. I&#8217;m sick of 2008 and am willing to take my chances with a different year. Summer too.</div>

Blogging vs doing presentations jml? ;-)<BR/><BR/>&#8216;Lord of Light&#8217; rang the highly vague bell. &#8216;Zelanzy&#8217; clicked.<BR/><BR/>*Very* odd book IMHO. I enjoyed it, but haven&#8217;t rushed to re-read. I found it &#8230; heavy going. I prefer a lighter read. I suspect the work separation thing :-)<BR/><BR/>Would explain why my Pratchett collection is almost in tatters.</div>

I like your blog because I like reading things people have to say, and it&#8217;s different to talking because if you were ranting on about something I totally disagreed with or didn&#8217;t care about I&#8217;d have to feel awkward or be rude, whereas if I&#8217;m reading I can just skip bits :p<BR/>I like blogs. I just wish there was a way to combine LJ and blogger so I could read ALL my friends updates - because I have an LJ I only hear about my three friends who are on that, and I have to check other people&#8217;s by remembering, so I&#8217;ll probably only read it for a month or so :(<BR/>Keep putting reminders on facebook :)</div>

I&#8217;m OK with science fiction. A lot of it is terribly written, but on the whole I accept the genre.<br /><br />That said, the kind I like best isn&#8217;t really science fiction, it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">economics fiction</span>, fiction that addresses what the world would be like if the rules of scarcity changed. Books like:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Dispossessed</span>, Ursula Le Guin (the best SF author ever. If you disagree, you are wrong.)</li><li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Culture</span> novels, Iain M. Banks</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Diamond Age</span>, Neal Stephenson (to a certain extent)</li></ul>In most of these stories, societies solve the &#8220;limited supply, unlimited demand&#8221; problem by inventing technology which provides an unlimited supply. Hence, they become &#8220;science&#8221; fiction.<br /><br />There&#8217;s also a short story by Lord Dunsany called &#8220;The Bureau d&#8217;Echanges de Maux&#8221; which describes a market where evils, rather than goods, can be traded. Of course, Dunsany doesn&#8217;t care about whether this market performs a useful economic function, so there&#8217;s still areas to explore.</div>

You may have seen the ads from our benevolent Government, telling us that we need to lose weight, trim down and start feeling better so we don&#8217;t crush our public health system under megatonnes of raw lard.<br /><br />You may have even gone to <a href="http://www.measureup.gov.au/internet/abhi/publishing.nsf">their website</a>, where you&#8217;ll find this wonderful gem:<br /><blockquote>The waist measurements above are recommended for Caucasian men, and Caucasian and Asian women. Recommended waist measurements are yet to be determined for all ethnic groups. It is believed that they may be lower for Asian men. They are also likely to be higher for Pacific Islanders and African Americans (men and women).</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>&#8220;African Americans&#8221;? Do black immigrants from the United States really make up that large a percentage of our population, or did the government just mean &#8220;people of African descent&#8221;?<br /><br />To me, it sounds as if someone indulged in <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit">mindless political correctness</a>.

So I&#8217;m sure I heard something the other day about fat people in Canada or something having a right to two plane seats for the price of one. Fair enough, I&#8217;m sure flying must be intensely uncomfortable for obese people, it&#8217;s bad enough for tall people.<BR/>However, I think if they&#8217;re going to have rules like that then people like me should either get cheaper tickets or automatically doubled baggage allowance. It&#8217;s only fair. Otherwise why SHOULDN&#8217;T I live on cheeseburgers? Won&#8217;t cost me any more to get around&#8230;<BR/>Damnit, if you want people to lose weight, give incentives to small people, not generosity to big people!</div>

Sure enough, looking all over the net I find quite a lot of different guesstimates of chronic illness risk. Oddly, the ones that talk about waist measurement alone generally have much higher figures than the Aus govt. one (ie, 37 inches, 93cm for women) and various others suggesting that yes, it perhaps may vary with height eg http://calorielab.com/news/2005/06/07/waist-to-height-ratio-best-health-predictor/<BR/><BR/>So as usual with rule of thumb public health metrics, who the hell knows?</div>

This one is notoriously common in online fandom when North Americans write about fictional black characters living in Europe, or even in Africa.<BR/><BR/>I think something slightly more subtle may be going on here: that the health studies they are relying on come from the United States. I have actually looked at some and believe they may use &#8220;African American&#8221; partly to make it clear what their population is: it&#8217;s people living in the United States. It&#8217;s not a given that that data can be extrapolated to all people of black African descent. (In fact, I would guess it&#8217;s unlikely, given the genetic diversity in Africans.)<BR/><BR/>However, this isn&#8217;t wholly consistent: they don&#8217;t make a similar point for Asians or for Caucasians for that matter.<BR/><BR/>I would guess the information is authored by an American writer and not completely edited for local appropriateness (as opposed to it being authored by an Australian).<BR/><BR/>I am curious about why the recommendations do not vary with height, myself. Do people of all heights and builds really have exactly the same waistline risks?</div>

I don&#8217;t find it a problem - I think of it as an exhaustive meditation on a cultural phenomenon rather than an argument, so if feels like my perspective is deepening&#8230;</div>

Yeah, I have to thank you for turning me on to Rankin, Benny. And Wind-up Bird Chroncile, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.<BR/><BR/>Sontag is brilliant &#8211; no doubt. My problem with <I>On Photography</I> is that she at no point makes a coherent argument. It&#8217;s like reading a very, very smart creative person writing something that has the cadence of an argument, but is actually a bunch of near-related assertions. <BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s doubly frustrating, because it makes it hard to tell what&#8217;s profound insight and what&#8217;s pretentious word play.</div>

I really like Ian Rankin, he is my crime/light reading sanctuary in a busy world of literature. <BR/><BR/>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is superb, and I sit at the feet of Susan Sontag, who must have been the smartest person ever. I&#8217;m reading her essays, Against Interpretation.<BR/><BR/>My co-worker, Irene, tells a Susan Sontag story. Her sister&#8217;s husband was the only person at a camera company who Annie Leibovitz would deal with. They were invited to dinner at Annie&#8217;s house, and her sister remembers being introduced to &#8220;Susan someone&#8221; and having an enjoyable dinner together. Irene tears her hair out, moderately, in a New York kind of way.</div>

Me too. I also love the strong sense of place that grows in his later novels.<BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s interesting reading &#8220;Knots and Crosses&#8221; (the first one) after reading several more recent ones. He&#8217;s become a much better writer since then.</div>

Right now, I&#8217;m in a small café near the Universität der Künste Berlin. It&#8217;s obvious that great symphonies and the occasional revolution have been plotted here in caffeinated oblivion. The place has yellowing musical manuscripts on the walls and lit candles to go with my hot chocolate. Since I last wrote from Berlin, I&#8217;ve wandered around the city and seen many of the sights: two stand out.<br /><br />The first is the East Side Gallery, a painted remnant of the wall that&#8217;s about ten minutes walk from where I&#8217;m staying. The gallery extends at least a kilometre and is filled with colour, freedom, love and hope. I wish I could write down all that it made me feel, but I can&#8217;t reach quite that far yet.<br /><br />The second is a war memorial to all those who&#8217;ve died in any war, on the way to Brandenburg Tor from Alexanderplatz. From the outside, it&#8217;s a simple brown stone building. What&#8217;s impressive is the inside.<br /><br />As you walk through the door, you see a dark room with high ceilings. The floor and walls are the kind of black-grey that reminds you of smoke, ash and death. The room itself is bare except for a statue in the middle, that looks like a person sitting. You can&#8217;t make out the face or sex of the figuce, but you <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> she must be weeping for her dead child. When I first stepped in, the only thing I could think was, &#8220;Oh God, what have we done?&#8221;.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been in buildings that were supposed to elevate the mind toward heaven, in houses that we designed to make me feel at home, cafes that make me feel more creative than I am and even haunted houses designed to make me feel scared. Until this week, I&#8217;ve never been in a building that conjures up the mix of grief and horror that comes from knowing that something is deeply, deeply wrong the human race and that I am a part of it.</div>

Living in Canberra has some advantages in terms of national events: I feel very fortunate&#8230; nay *privileged*, to have been present for the entombment of the Unknown Solider at the War Memorial.<BR/>I have never since known Canberra to be so quiet; to be surrounded by so many people with tears streaming down their faces - myself among them - while the lone bugler played The Last Post.<BR/><BR/>Some things are unforgettable. Some things should never be forgotten.<BR/>Cheers</div>
