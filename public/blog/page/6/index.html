A couple of weeks ago, Joliette and I got married in the sight of God and men. The day itself is a happy blur in my head, full of smiling friends and family, wonderful food, great music, some very serious words and, of course, her.<br /><br />Right now, I&#8217;m sitting in the garden of the flat that we now live in together, catching up on three weeks of work. The flat is still a bit of a work in progress, with empty boxes and piles of junk belonging to the landlord and previous tenants lying around the place, taking up valuable room that we could be using to pile up <i>our</i>&nbsp;junk.<br /><br />It&#8217;s good be back at work though. I suspect it will get even better when my team mates turn in Argentina and Canada actually wake up.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Happy applause from this side of the pond!  <br /><br />Seeing you is long overdue, and I hope won&#39;t remain that way for long, but in the meantime, congratulations J &amp; J.  It sounds like the wedding was everything a wedding should be, too.<br /><br />Warm wishes,<br />-Karl</div>

I have a post in my backlog about a couple of books I&#8217;ve recently read. However, what with moving house, my folks visiting, the upcoming wedding and the usual hectic pre-release, pre-UDS panic at work, I haven&#8217;t had the time to polish it into something readable.<br /><br />So, in lieu of actual thoughts and considerations, here&#8217;s a list of what I&#8217;ve finished reading recently:<br /><br /><ul><li></li><li>Ancient Rome: From the earliest times down to 476 AD, Robert Franklin Pennell</li><li>An Evil Guest, Gene Wolfe (thanks dash!)</li><li>Crystal Cave, Mary Stewart</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>, Anonymous</li><li>Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier</li><li>Strong Poison, Dorothy Sayers</li><li>This Momentary Marriage, John Piper</li><li>Pre-Christian Ireland, Peter Harbison</li></ul>Currently working my way through a bunch of books.<br /><br /><ul><li>Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad</li><li>Innovator&#8217;s Solution, Michael E. Raynor and Clayton M. Christensen</li><li>The Quantum Universe, Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw</li><li>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen R. Covey</li><li>ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, Hadley Wickham</li><li>Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers, Allen B. Downey</li></ul><div>Believe it or not, this is actually a kind of success in my attempt to be reading fewer books at once. The main lessons learned so far are not to set aside hard books so quickly and to start taking notes on genuinely interesting non-fiction books from the beginning. &#8220;7 Habits&#8221; and &#8220;Innovator&#8217;s Solution&#8221; are still on there because I had to double back and re-read to note down things.</div></div>

A few weeks ago, I lost my jacket.<br /><br />It was a nice jacket. The nicest jacket I&#8217;ve ever owned. It fit well, it was warm, I looked good in it, it was black and the pockets would fit a paperback or a Kindle. Everything that a jacket could be to a man, that jacket was to me.<br /><br />It was my fault I lost it. When the train pulled in to Chalfont &amp; Latimer, I was nestled comfortably in my seat, buried deep in some hacking and enjoying the subtle afterglow of the couple of glasses of Malbec I&#8217;d had with dinner. The stop took me by surprise. I rushed. I grabbed my laptop, my book and even felt a little proud of not forgetting my water bottle as I dashed off the train and plunged into the cold and lonely night air that seems to cling to country railway platforms. Meanwhile, that best of all jackets was in the rack above a seat no longer mine.<br /><br />At this point, I lost my temper too. Were it not for Joliette&#8217;s heroic patience and level-headedness, I would have haunted the station for hours, moaning incoherently at whatever staff I could find. Eventually, I became aware of her gently explaining to me that I should check in at Marylebone Station on Sunday, and &nbsp;again in two weeks time. Don&#8217;t give up hope, she said.<br /><br />I checked in on Sunday, and filed some paper-work. They also told me not to give up hope. I think I mustered a smile to pretend I wasn&#8217;t going to. Two weeks went by, and I went in again and Joliette called them up, but still no jacket. I gave it up as lost, and started looking for a new one.<br /><br />It was a nice jacket though, and apparently nice jackets like these are a bit like nice mangos, and cannot be bought out of season. After much browsing, searching and shopping, I couldn&#8217;t find a replacement in my size. I even got in touch with the manufacturer, who said that it was no longer for sale and my best bet was to try their factory outlets. I don&#8217;t have the money, though, and winter might end any day now.<br /><br />Today, though, I received an email from Marylebone Station, asking me if I had lost a jacket. I said yes, and very kind lady at the other end of the email said that they had an unclaimed jacket, and that she&#8217;d used her brain and checked the pockets. In one jacket, she had found a print-out of an email that had something to do with boxing, addressed to me. They&#8217;d had no paper-work and were surprised I hadn&#8217;t noticed that it was missing, after all, it was a nice jacket.<br /><br />As I sailed out of Marylebone today, I&#8217;m sure I looked better than I had in weeks. Whether it was the smile or the jacket, I couldn&#8217;t say.</div>

<div>I keep a pretty extensive todo list. I don&#8217;t really know if it helps me do more things or be more reliable, but it certainly comforts me.</div><div><br /></div><div>But how do I actually pick items off it? How do I actually decide what to do? Here are a few of the strategies that I use, for better or worse.</div><div><br /></div><div>I apply these strategies only after filtering out items that I simply cannot do because of my current circumstances. e.g. I can&#8217;t make phone calls from the tube.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Meet the deadline</b></div><div>Something needs to be done today, so I&#8217;ll do that. The beauty is its simplicity.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Do something fun</b></div><div>I&#8217;ll look at my todo list and after careful and thoughtful consideration of priorities, time frames, personal responsibilities and life goals, will do whatever I wanted to do in the first place.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Shorten the list as much as possible</b></div><div>When I go through the list trying to get rid of as many items as possible, aiming for the shorter and easier ones. Generally happens in a mad panic on a Friday afternoon. The biggest danger is that I make a mistake in guessing how long something will take and end up stuck on one task forever.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Kill the oldest item</b></div><div>This thing has been on my plate <i>forever.</i>&nbsp;If I do it now, I&#8217;ll feel like a Much Better Person.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Finish off one project</b></div><div>Because it&#8217;s cool to reach an actual outcome, rather than eternally making progress. This is almost always impossible to do.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Now or never</b></div><div>If I don&#8217;t do this particular todo right now, I know I&#8217;m never going to come back to it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>While I&#8217;m doing this I might as well&#8230;</b></div><div>Not so much consulting my todo list as letting my mind&#8217;s vagueness and the distractions surrounding one task lead me into another. Often ends up as productive and valuable time spent. I guess I irrationally believe that conscious choices are better, somehow.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Tackle the most daunting task first</b></div><div>Often the oldest item is the most daunting, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I guess I could expand &#8220;most daunting task&#8221; to mean &#8220;the task I find myself thinking about the most&#8221;. Thinking how one should really do a thing after one has already decided to do a thing is a waste of valuable energy, so sometimes it&#8217;s better to just do it.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>What will I not naturally do?</b></div><div>A lot of the things on my todo list are things that I&#8217;ll get around to in due course anyway. Part of the power-up that a todo list grants is the ability to choose to do things you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise do. These don&#8217;t have to be daunting things, they can be fun, or exploratory, or mundane. Something like writing a small program in an interesting new programming language, or finally getting to grips with what a financial derivative really is. These things often fall into the &#8220;important but not urgent&#8221; category.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Personal utility</b></div><div>What thing can I do that will improve my life the most? I use this one the least, although arguably it is the most rational.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>There&#8217;s some overlap between these categories, but I think they are different enough to be useful to me in improving my self-awareness, and perhaps even in making better decisions about how to use the time God has given me.</div></div>

Heh, I find myself doing all those too.<br /><br />Plus a few others:<br /><br />* It&#39;s something someone recently asked about.  The more people that care about something, the more important it seems to me.<br /><br />* Doing this will enable me to cross of several other items pretty easily.<br /><br />* It&#39;s the type of task that once done, it&#39;s done.  Not one of those tasks that as soon as you finish it, you realize there&#39;s 6 more follow-on tasks that you&#39;ll have to add to your todo list.<br /><br />* I organize my tasks by project, and at the start of the month select one or two projects to work on each day of the month.  So, I&#39;ll try to weight myself towards picking off an item off that project&#39;s todo list.  Still have to go through the whole process of &quot;which task to pick&quot;, but constraining it to the one project makes it a shorter list to pick from.</div>

Following the resolutions in <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2012/02/reading.html">my last post on reading</a>, I&#8217;ve finally finished two of the heavier books that I&#8217;d started: <i>The Art of Rhetoric</i>&nbsp;by Aristotle, and <i>The Kalevala</i>, a cycle of Finnish epic poetry. Some reflections:<div><br /></div><div><i>The Kalevala</i></div><div><ul><li>I actually only read the first volume, which is the first twenty songs</li><li>For what it is, it&#8217;s surprisingly readable and engaging. Good stories, lots of vivid poetic images, even some humour</li><li>The introduction compared it to other great ancient epics, such as the Iliad</li><li>It&#8217;s written in trochaic tetrameter (<b>tum</b>-ti-<b>tum</b>-ti-<b>tum</b>-ti-<b>tum</b>-ti) and translated that way too. That metre is particularly infectious and I found my internal monologue beating that way after reading a section</li><ul><li><i>The Song of Hiawatha </i>is written that way too, apparently inspired by <i>The Kalevala</i></li></ul><li>I knew nothing about Finnish mythology and now I know next to nothing but here&#8217;s some stuff:</li><ul><li>There&#8217;s no pantheon and not many obvious gods, just one high God, &#8220;Ukko&#8221;</li><li>Most of the characters don&#8217;t seem like ordinary men and women. The translation says &#8220;heroes&#8221;, which fits, but you need to think bigger than Odysseus or Achilles</li><li>Birch trees, some constellations, the moon and the sun all are persons, in some fashion</li><li>Mothers matter way more than fathers</li></ul><li>Really wish I knew more about its provenance. It&#8217;s hard to tell how much is truly ancient, how much has been influenced by Christianity and how much was made up by the compiler.</li><li>Lots of singing. If you hated Tom Bombadil or the <i>Silmarillion</i> (Mikey, I&#8217;m looking at you), then you should probably skip this one</li><li>I&#8217;m probably not going to read Volume 2 any time soon</li></ul><div><i>The Art of Rhetoric</i></div><div><br /></div><div>This is the first Aristotle I&#8217;ve ever read. I&#8217;m really interested in the subject, initially because I wanted to be conscious of when I&#8217;m using rhetorical tricks and when they are being used on me.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>The book is more than just a series of tricks. It&#8217;s about the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of persuasive speech: what kinds of arguments there are; how to come up with them; which ones are best suited for which purposes; what things work regardless of what kind of speech you are making; how emotions fit into things and so forth. What I had previously thought of as rhetoric – rhetorical style – is a smallish bit at the end.</div><div><br /></div><div>It&#8217;s a really tough, technical read. Lots and lots of it didn&#8217;t stick, and I am sure it would repay a deeper study. The translator tries his best, and his introduction was helpful, but even he tended to be cumbersome. He once described something as being &#8220;not inimitable&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know what that means.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even though it&#8217;s really tough and technical, I was impressed by Aristotle. When I was growing up, I mostly knew of him as the guy who got science completely wrong and helped screw up the Middle Ages. Reading this, he comes across as very sharp, creative and interesting. Also, since he and the translator frequently refer to his other works, he comes across as very prolific. It&#8217;s amazing how many different fields he contributed to. I realize this isn&#8217;t exactly news.</div><div><br /></div><div>It also makes me realize just how much cool stuff was going on in Classical Greece, and how modern much of it seems to me. I guess I&#8217;m late to this game too, but when I read things like this I feel as if our culture has this super-interesting older cousin with an excellent music collection who we never talk to because we can&#8217;t be bothered. Or something.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wish I had a classical education, or at least that I could go off and study classics for a while. I really think I would learn things that would be useful today. Or perhaps our culture has absorbed everything that is useful or good or relevant about their culture and it would all be a mildly diverting exercise in academic self-gratification.</div></div>

<div>A few quick reflections on my recent reading:</div><div><ul><li>Have decided to apply kanban principles and limit my books in progress and my queue of next books</li><li>Have set myself a rule that I&#8217;m not going to start any new books until I&#8217;ve cleared off the ones on my bedside table and the ones in my &#8220;In progress&#8221; collection on my Kindle</li><li>Just finished &#8220;I sleep in haysheds and corners&#8221;. Some stories are better than others. I particularly liked the opening story for its Tasmaniana and Will Cox&#8217;s story.</li><li>Also just finished &#8220;Why Classical Music Still Matters&#8221;. Many good ideas, but ultimately disappointing as the author insists on florid prose in the tradition of critical theory. This makes some points impenetrable and others seem like literary word games. Would love to read a book on this topic that was more direct.</li><li>I don&#8217;t keep a reading log. Benny &amp; Jean-Paul both do, and I was taught to by my old mentor Martin Chance, but I don&#8217;t. I should. I want to. How does one start so late in the game? What format does one use?</li></ul><div>Also, I&#8217;m more active on <a href="https://plus.google.com/115348217455779620753/posts">Google</a>+ these days than on my blog. You might want to follow me there.</div></div></div>

At Canonical, we normally work in a distributed environment. As such, when we do get together, it&#8217;s either for intense, multiple day meetings or intense, multiple day hacking sessions. Either way, there&#8217;s a bunch of useful talk and progress, and this often needs to get written up.<br /><br />While minutes and daily reports are a barrel of fun, for actually <i>doing</i>&nbsp;things and telling others how much you&#8217;ve done, you only really need to record three types of thing:<br /><br /><ol><li>Next Actions – what you&#8217;re going to do next, and who&#8217;s going to do it</li><li>Decisions – you&#8217;ve had discussions and come to conclusions, what were they?</li><li>Achievements – things that actually got done during the meeting / hacking session</li></ol><div>You can remember these with the convenient acronym, NADA.</div></div>

<a href="http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/m#node-21529761">According to The Economist</a>:<br /><blockquote>Money has three main qualities:<br /><ol><li>as a medium of exchange, buyers can give it to sellers to pay for goods and services;&nbsp;</li><li>as a unit of account, it can be used to add up apples and oranges in some common value;</li><li>as a store of value, it can be used to transfer purchasing power into the future.</li></ol></blockquote>Can time be a medium of exchange? I guess sort of, but it&#8217;s a little like barter for services. Much better to use money for that.<br /><br />I guess it can be used as a unit of account. It took me as long to write this as it takes me to fold my laundry and clean my room. Learning French to conversational levels might take as much time as playing through&nbsp;Arkham Asylum and&nbsp;the next Assassin&#8217;s Creed. Useful things to&nbsp;know.<br /><br />Turns out you can&#8217;t store time though. Those few minutes of spare time you have can&#8217;t be put into a time bank and then redeemed for extra spare time in the future. It goes stale very quickly.</div>
