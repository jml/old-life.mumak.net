It used to be that if you asked me which super-power I wanted, I would tell you, &#8220;instantaneous, effortless, accurate, error-free teleportation&#8221;. Something very much like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/">Jumper</a>,&nbsp;except with fewer determined foes and better acting. After all, that would mean no more flights, no more uphill walks, no more being late, no more forgetting things and plenty more holidays.<br /><br />But recently, I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I want to be <i>Video Game Man</i>. I want the super-powers that every video game character actually has that aren&#8217;t even treated as super-powers.<br /><br /><b>Infinite stamina: </b>Practically every video game character can run, jump, climb and fight forever without becoming tired, experiencing fatigue or slowing down in any way. This would make kickboxing much easier.<br /><br /><b>Self-sustaining:</b>&nbsp;No need to eat, drink or sleep. Well, maybe if I got injured I could eat an apple to cure me. Think of the time saved.<br /><br /><b>Pause:</b>&nbsp;When things get too confusing or fast-paced, or when a difficult decision must be made, I could pause and take as much time as I wanted to think about it. Of course, it would only be thinking.<br /><br /><b>Quick save, quick load:</b>&nbsp;Attempt difficult situations over and over again. Accidental death would not be a problem. Negotiations could be optimized. Future knowledge could be used to enhance past decisions.<br /><br /><b>Friend or foe: </b>Know instantly who the bad guys are. No more moral ambiguity for me, thank you very much!<br /><br /><b>Know thyself:</b>&nbsp;Clear knowledge of all of my own capabilities – no more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> for me! – and also of my own status, health, wealth etc. Always obvious what I could improve and how much I could improve.<br /><br /><b>Maps:</b>&nbsp;Always knowing where I am, and where I need to go.<br /><br /><b>Unbreakable: </b>Although I could be injured, it would be impossible to break my limbs, blind me, deafen me, or even slow me down. No possible accident could reduce or remove any of my innate capabilities.<br /><br />Looking over this list, I&#8217;m reminded of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">The Culture</a>, a utopia designed by Iain M. Banks and the little I know of the <a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Gamification_Books/Reality_Is_Broken">Reality is Broken</a> meme. Which reminds me, most reader of this blog should look at &#8221;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dings/dont-play-games-with-me-promises-and-pitfalls-of-gameful-design">Don&#8217;t Play Games With Me</a>&#8221;.<br /><br />Oh, and if you&#8217;re able to get me that teleporting gig, I guess I could be convinced to settle for that.</div>

Infinite stamina: Battlefield 1942 had stamina that went down when you jumped or ran; when it was empty, you could do neither. Of course, it regenerates, so it is infinite in a way.<br /><br />Self-sustaining: The Ship. You must eat, drink, and use the toilets to survive. Pathologic requires you to eat, drink, and sleep.<br /><br />Pause: I can&#39;t think of a game where not pausing is a notable, intentional feature.<br /><br />Quick save, quick load: Prince of Persia. Not only did it not have quicksave or quickload, it didn&#39;t allow you to save or load at all&#8211;you had to complete the game in one hour.<br /><br />Friend or foe: Team Fortress 2. The Spy. He&#39;s behind you.<br /><br />Know thyself: I don&#39;t know any games where you don&#39;t know your status and/or abilities as an intentional, significant feature.<br /><br />Maps: Half-Life 2. No map. No explicit direction of where to go. Of course, being largely linear, you don&#39;t have a lot of choice.<br /><br />Unbreakable: Deus Ex. Your arms, legs, head, and torso sustained damage independently. If your right arm was damaged too far, you could no longer hold a weapon. If both legs were damaged too far, you could no longer walk, but only crawl.</div>

Winter is dragging on in London. There&#8217;s a tree outside my window, perhaps I&#8217;ve told you about it before. When I first moved here a year and a half ago, its branches were bare and through the gaps between the ends I could see a dead building made of black and glass and a solid grey sky. It&#8217;s like that now. Every time I look out my window I hope to see flowers budding or leaves growing, telling me that Spring is really here.<br /><br />It&#8217;s odd to care so much about it, and to look for those signs. In Australia, so many plants are evergreen, and you have to be as far south as Tasmania for seasons to mean much. Flower buds and singing birds are the sort of metaphors you read in books and have to be explained to you, in much the way that the rain-in-a-dry-land metaphors in the Bible have to be explained to the British.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spent the morning replying to personal correspondence, most of which has been sitting in a virtual drawer for months and months. I confess that a part of me saw it as a duty that had to be done, but that part quickly shrivelled once I actually started to re-read and reply to the emails. What I dreaded from a distance as a chore quickly became a pleasure when up close, and I truly am blessed to have such friends.<br /><br />Now there are lazy Sunday chores to do before I&#8217;m off to church. Cleaning, organizing, reviewing lists, making lists and carefully avoiding becoming lost in code, books or video games.</div>

There are a lot of interesting people on Twitter, and it seems like a good way to be part of a broader conversation. I quite like the short format of Facebook status update, so it figures that tweeting should come naturally.<br /><br />The problem is I always slide off Twitter like a sock off a warm glass window (try it sometime!). I just can&#8217;t stick to it. Anyone else had this problem? Is it a tech thing or an attitude thing? Am I better off leaving it alone?</div>

What suddenly got me into using Twitter was attending a developers conference in 2009* where a majority of the other attendees used it. I met a lot of people, talked with them, and got their twitter handles.<br /><br />After the conference was over, this made it much easier to keep in touch with what was going on in this scene. It sort of fit the same general feel as the discussions in the pub every night during the conference: a lot of informal chatter, some excellent discussions, and listening in or weighing in on whatever is relevant or interesting to me.<br /><br />I now use a twitter client on my desktop machine, skimming through tweets every now and again. The group of people I follow has broadened well beyond just Cocoa developers, and into other areas of interest to me.<br /><br />The final thing that clicked for me about it is the asymmetry of the “follow” relationship. I follow people because I’m interested in what they’re saying, but I have no expectation of them following me back. And I unfollow anyone without remorse if I’m no longer interested in their tweets, or they’re tweeting the latest stupid meme too much. I can always peek at their timeline later and follow again if I want to. The asymmetry of this is very different to “friend” relationships on Facebook: partly because those are only reciprocal, and partly because the term “friend” is very loaded, and “unfriending” carries implications of falling out.<br /><br />For me, twitter is like sitting in a huge IRC channel, but with a whitelist instead of a blacklist deciding what I see. And shorter messages.<br /><br />*NSConference, not Europython, though it had the same effect to some extent.</div>

I think the thing to remember about Twitter is that it is for mobile phones, not computers.  But I agree with Tom&#39;s points too.</div>

I think Facebook&#39;s &quot;Top News&quot; functionality is a major lack on Twitter. (Also, a character limit closer to 500 characters would be helpful.)</div>

I just made a twitter comeback for the same reasons you mention, but I can already remember why I left it twice before:<br /><br />1. 140 characters is very restrictive. It&#39;s hard to say anything meaningful.<br /><br />2. The short URLs are scary. Is it only me? It seems completely unnatural to me to click on a link without having any idea where it&#39;s going.<br /><br />3. The volume is hard to manage. Once you start following enough people you get loads of info, and it&#39;s very unbalanced - some users tweet a lot and some hardly at all.<br /><br /><br />I find that using it from the phone (I&#39;m using the Android client - which is really well done) feels better, so I think I might keep it as a phone-only thing (that should also help make sure I don&#39;t waste time I could spend doing useful things on Twitter - I still don&#39;t do anything particularly useful on the phone).</div>

I mentioned a while ago how it felt like I&#8217;d been living in some pretty big times. Since then, subjective time has been torn out of the shoulder socket of habit and things have been in a bit of a mess. A good mess, but a mess nevertheless. There&#8217;s nothing for it but to recount what&#8217;s happened.<div><br /></div><div>Buckets of fun were had over Christmas. I spent the Eve and the Day with Ian and Rowan, two friends from church who shared a wonderfully family-like Christmas with me. Ro even made a stocking with my name on it. I lost every single board game I played, but there was nice port. I also got a chance to have a video call with most of my Tasmanian family. Funny to think that was the first time I saw my parents in over a year.</div><div><br /></div><div>After that, I returned home and played video games for a week solid, while Joliette and practically everyone else were away. <i>Enslaved </i>is very good, and&nbsp;<i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> is even better, but you probably knew that already.</div><div><br /></div><div>Square-eye fun ended, the new year rolled around and I packed my bags and went to Dallas for three weeks. Now, there are many fine people who live in Dallas, many of whom have been kind to me. But it&#8217;s a hole.</div><div><br /></div><div>Granted, I spent most of the time in a hotel in conference rooms without natural sunlight talking about some of the more arcane aspects of distributed open source software development, but even so, it&#8217;s not one of my top ten favourite cities. In each of <i>those</i>&nbsp;cities, you do not need a car to cross the street.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first week in Dallas was spent doing the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">single geekiest thing</a> that has ever been done in that city. Our old group from Tassie was re-formed, along with special guest James Whelan. My monk kicked arse.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eventually, after both play and work were done, I left Dallas (yay!) and went home to London. Jetlag has thrown the time out of joint in a different way, although if I had more discipline I would recover faster. Returning to kickboxing after six weeks out of practice is an exercise in humility, as was watching some of the clips from my grading session.</div><div><br /></div><div>J &amp; I went to see Hamlet on Wednesday. It&#8217;s my first time watching it on stage, and the first performance J has ever seen. I was very pleased. I had forgotten just how good it is. The production emphasised the constant surveillance of the Danish court, Kinnear played the Dane as a hyper-sensitive introvert who shields himself with wit, and <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/59912/company-members/david-calder.html">Calder</a>&nbsp;did an excellent Polonius.</div><div><br /></div><div>Driving goes well. After warming up a bit I seemed to be as good as I was six weeks ago. Apparently, I&#8217;ve just got to master maneuvres, roundabouts and the motorway before I&#8217;m ready for my test.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, did my first ever yoga class yesterday. I was expecting it to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very flexible. It turned out to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very strong. I&#8217;m surprised that the male yoga practitioners I know don&#8217;t look substantially beefier, to be honest. Also, I hadn&#8217;t expected to break a sweat. Nice that there wasn&#8217;t much of a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; element to that, as there are certain teachings that I cannot submit to nor appear to submit to.</div><div><br /></div><div>That&#8217;s it, I think. Hope all is going well with you.</div></div>

We&#8217;ve had some big times over the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, my mind was focused on grading, on the day when I would be tested to see if I would be awarded a blue belt for kick-boxing. Everything reminded me of grading, or was bad because it might harm my chances, or was good because it would help, or was too big to think about before grading. All plans and thoughts passed through the nexus of that cold Sunday morning in a large indoor dojo.<br /><br />On the day, I felt this strange mix of confidence and uncertainty. I was healthy, I had trained hard, I knew all of the techniques, my teachers said I was ready and I <i>really</i>&nbsp;wanted that belt, but&nbsp;I had never done anything this physically demanding or &#8220;sporty&#8221; before and I didn&#8217;t know if some rebel part of my mind would tell me to quit half-way through.<br /><br />The grading was hard, but I passed. I&#8217;ve been awarded my blue belt, and I have to say that there are few achievements of which I am more proud.<br /><br />If all I&#8217;d done over the last two weeks had been to get this belt, it would have been a big two weeks.<br /><br />But of course, I also went ice skating. It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve been in ice skates on a rink, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve actually <i>skated</i>&nbsp;in those ice skates on a rink. It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s stressful in the same way learning to drive in London is stressful, something is always veering out in front of you daring you to maim it with your beginner&#8217;s ignorance.<br /><br />I have also done my woefully late Christmas shopping, a great Pyrrhic victory in which I lost hours and sterling and self-respect. I wish I had a better knack of demonstrating affection through the giving of gifts.<br /><br />Christmas shopping, ice skating, kick-boxing, what else? Oh yes, Barcelona. Joliette and I spent the week there with friends and it was wonderful. I got a little ill during the middle of it, which meant that we lolled about indoors as much as we strolled about outside. Even so, we saw some great things.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_familia">Sagrada Familía</a>&nbsp;has been renovated since I last saw it. All of the interior scaffolding has been taken down and inside it&#8217;s almost complete. To describe it would only be to belittle it. We were speechless and amazed for ten full minutes after we crossed the threshold.<br /><br />There&#8217;s more, of course. Over the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve walked among ancient wonders, seen Herbie Hancock play live, heard beautiful and pure voices sing carols at the Royal Albert Hall, had an actual decent plate of eggs benedict in London and drank a mug of the most chocolatey hot chocolate that ever was.<br /><br />Sadly, I never got to try the panther milk.</div>

Nothing wrong with commenting on an old post, especially given the rate I post here.<br /><br />1) Thank you :)<br /><br />2) Ahh yes.

Yes, yes, yes, commenting on an old post. But:<br /><br />1) Congrats on the belt. Awesomeness.<br /><br />2) The most chocolatey hot chocolate that ever was is from Les Deux Magots in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Would go beautifully with churros, but the waiters might look at you with more disdain than usual.<br /><br />3) Joliette?</div>

Barcelona.  It was essentially dipping chocolate for churros.  We both finished ours, but I suspect that if we hadn&#39;t it would have solidified.</div>

Sounds like you&#39;re enjoying life jml - good to hear.<br /><br />But was that hot chocolate in London or Barcelona? I bought a hot chocolate in Barcelona recently and it was so chocalatey that I couldn&#39;t actually finish (which is something!). To my surprise, when it cooled, it solidified!</div>

Anyone else notice how December has sneaked up on us this year? Normally it just stands there, proud, forbidding and distant, waiting for us to come to it. This time though, December has thrown off its gaudy robes, donned a black ski mask and starting running silently through bushes and backflipping over rooftops &nbsp;in order to trap us in a <i>stealth ninja attack</i>.<br /><br />I have a theory. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t actually think December is some kind of rogue assassin months with training in the mystical arts – that would be silly. &nbsp;I think that the G8 has been secretly selling off bits of October to the Chinese government.<br /><br />Think about it. Everyone knows that October has thirty-one days, because otherwise there wouldn&#8217;t be a Halloween, but it always <i>feels</i>&nbsp;like it should be a thirty day month. &nbsp;Winter came early this year. Why? Because there were actually fewer days in October to separate it from Summer. &nbsp;A day here, a day there, sliced off, packaged and sent to China where they use it to dissipate some of the excess energy from their over-heated economy.<br /><br />All I&#8217;m saying is, don&#8217;t be surprised when next year you are sitting back, feeling all smug and self-congratulatory in your August armchair and then BAM! it&#8217;s mid-November and you are wondering what just happened to the year and trying to figure out when you&#8217;ll find time to do your Christmas shopping.<br /><br />Don&#8217;t ask me how it works, I&#8217;m not a Communist.</div>

I&#8217;ve been thinking more recently about keeping the amount of work I have in progress to a minimum. &nbsp;Having a small number of things on the go at once means that you actually finish those things quicker, and finishing things is great.<br /><br />GTD isn&#8217;t great at helping me do this, because new projects just go onto my projects list and new actions on my actions list. What I really need is a backlog, a list of projects that are queued up waiting for me to finish one of my current projects.<br /><br />This is a little like the someday/maybe list of GTD, feels at least to me to be conceptually different.<br /><br />Any other personal organization geeks thought about this? Any tips?</div>

I think kanban-style visualisation of what you&#39;ve got in progress as well as in your backlog is great for this.<br /><br />Of course, lots of people are already doing this, things like <a href="http://www.personalkanban.com/pk/" rel="nofollow">personal kanban</a> are worth a look.<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;m keen to visualise this kind of thing for learning goals&#8230; it&#39;s at the top of my list of things to do when I have spare time :)</div>

Hey Jonno, I use RTM for personal to do management, so for me at least it&#39;s fairly easy. I just make the next few things I need to do either priority two or three. Stuff I /have/ to do soon is priority one, and the remainder doesn&#39;t have a priority. As stuff gets done I move the other items up in priority. It might not work if you have heaps of tasks, but I generally have about 250 or so on the go at any time, and it seems to work for me.</div>

I have thought about this <i>quite</i> a bit, and I&#39;ve basically only gotten as far as you have.  I am attentively following any future developments.<br /><br />One of the nice things about my current job is that it has actually restricted the scope of my spare-time activities somewhat, which at first seemed limiting but in retrospect has actually been very helpful.  I have discovered that I have substantially more spare-time hacking than I can ever <i>hope</i> to make any progress on.</div>

I just got back from three hours of kick-boxing, and am pretty exhausted – &#8220;cream crackered&#8221; as they say over here. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been in over a week, since I had a cold for much of last week.<br /><br />Apart from the obvious physical demands, kick-boxing is quite demanding mentally, at least to the beginner. It&#8217;s a little bit like being a beginner at driving, in that there are many things you have to remember to do correctly <i>all of the time, </i>there is no time at which you can forget any of them.<br /><br />You have to keep your guard up at all times, fists clenched at your temples. Your fists have to be clenched properly and tightly with the thumb tucked away over the fingers. You must keep shuffling: moving around, bouncing, bobbing, weaving at all times – even when listening to instructions. &nbsp;But you mustn&#8217;t shuffle during a combo. &nbsp;During the combo, pivot for reverse punches, hook punches, uppercuts, side kicks and roundhouses, but stay straight for front kicks, jabs and back hands. Ki-ai (i.e. shout, for me it&#8217;s sort of a &#8220;Tsuh!&#8221; sound) at the end of your combo. Keep shuffling. Don&#8217;t punch or kick too hard, just &#8220;sting&#8221; the pad / sparring partner. &nbsp;Return hands to guard as quickly as possible after a punch.<br /><br />It&#8217;s a lot to keep in mind. &nbsp;The nice thing is that, like driving, more and more of it becomes automatic as you keep doing it. Still, I&#8217;m a bit worried that I&#8217;ll have a brain-related failure during my grading on Sunday week.</div>

ok, so maybe &quot;really good&quot; at all three was a little inaccurate</div>

This reminds me of learning to ski and dance - and drive. Each time I found the process highly unpleasant. But the dogged perseverance needed to aquire these skills has served me well. *And* I&#39;ve actually managed to get really good at all three. Now I relish the fact that the basics come automatically, leaving me to attend to grace and expression. It&#39;s totally worth it.</div>

<blockquote></blockquote>Just came across this post that I had started a while ago and never finished. I thought it was interesting enough to share.<br /><br />I <s>recently</s> watched <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success.html">Alain de Botton talk about a gentler, kinder success</a>, and I recommend that you do the same.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear echoes of earlier writing in his arguments. Indeed, it showed remarkable discipline to be able to talk about the great role that chance plays in personal success without quoting <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209:11&amp;version=NIV">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.<br /><br />De Botton also discussed envy. Envy, he argues, is largely created by a belief in equality. I think he&#8217;s right, and that he&#8217;s right to say it. However, I could have sworn I read a similar thing in something C. S. Lewis wrote, and it turns out I did: <a href="http://screwtapeblogs.wordpress.com/2009/06/30/screwtape-proposes-a-toast/">Screwtape Proposes a Toast</a>. It is one of Lewis&#8217;s poorer pieces where he writes about the English education system and small government and other claptrap under the guise of writing about the human spiritual condition.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Lewis&#8217;s essay feels horribly dated and rather cantankerous. De Botton&#8217;s talk is friendly and witty and warm. Ecclesiastes is beautiful, concise and somewhat disheartening. True things stay true, and bear repeating in new ways and new contexts.</div></div>

I&#8217;ve been eligible to apply for a driving license for a little over a decade now, but I still haven&#8217;t got one. &nbsp;Partly it&#8217;s because of an unusual schooling, partly because I&#8217;ve lived in walking or public transport distance of everywhere I wanted to go, partly because I just don&#8217;t get off on cars the way some do but mostly because I&#8217;m lazy.<br /><br />However, driving is an important life skill, since a decade is long enough&nbsp;and since not having a car is a pain when I visit Tasmania, I am learning to drive.<br /><br />Of course, this means learning to drive <i>in London. </i>Here&#8217;s something of how it goes.<br /><br />I wake up at a time carefully calculated to be as late as possible, but to give me enough time to consume and absorb my usual pot of coffee before the lesson starts. I leave the house and look around to discover whether today is going to be a driving in fog day or a driving in the rain day. I then turn up the mews and carefully navigate the maze of construction work (at one point vaulting a guard rail) just so my driving instructor can pick me up in a spot that&#8217;s outside of the congestion zone.<br /><br />As he pulls up in the middle of the busy main road just off Paddington station, I dive into the tiny car, shake his hand and we drive off to the canals some four or five minutes away.&nbsp;Then we swap around, I take the wheel and do my best to enjoy two of the more stressful hours of my week.<br /><br />I spend those hours in a constant state of crisis management. London grew up for people, horses and carts, not automobiles, so the streets are winding and narrow. This is partly what I love about the city, but it does make learning to drive that much harder.<br /><br />The roads have lanes in much the same way that Britain has a constitution: they exist; they are not written down; they are generally followed and your safest bet is to do the same thing as whoever comes before you.<br /><br />A two-way street inevitably has cars parked along both sides, making it wide enough for only one care at a time. Halfway through there will be some kind of road works, just beyond which a mother will be pushing a pram out to cross the street. If I manage to dodge the road works and heroically save the child&#8217;s life, a delivery van will reverse out of its parking spot to cross both of the lanes. Then there are the buses and cyclists and cab drivers who are all deliberately trying to get me to have an accident.<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The real highlight is when I get to enjoy the freedom of the open road: no traffic, no obstructions, just me zooming along at a reckless thirty miles an hour (50km/h). I tell you, I feel almost giddy.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><br />Though each week I&#8217;m getting a little bit better. I&#8217;m really hoping to be able to do the test and pass before I head to Australia this April, so I can pootle along the Southern Outlet behind the logging trucks and find my way into the comforts of Hobart.</div>

I enjoyed reading this. I can just picture you and your instructor trying to make roads of pokey lanes.</div>

Good luck! I hope there&#39;s somewhere near you where you can practice starting on hills, or driving around Hobart could be quite the tire-spinning adventure :)</div>

Narrow lanes, road works, prams, reversing vans&#8230; surely you forgot the enormous pane of glass being carried across the road by some hapless tradesmen.  Perhaps next lesson?<br /><br />Good luck with the lessons and eventual test!</div>
