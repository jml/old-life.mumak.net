<a href="http://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/m#node-21529761">According to The Economist</a>:<br /><blockquote>Money has three main qualities:<br /><ol><li>as a medium of exchange, buyers can give it to sellers to pay for goods and services;&nbsp;</li><li>as a unit of account, it can be used to add up apples and oranges in some common value;</li><li>as a store of value, it can be used to transfer purchasing power into the future.</li></ol></blockquote>Can time be a medium of exchange? I guess sort of, but it&#8217;s a little like barter for services. Much better to use money for that.<br /><br />I guess it can be used as a unit of account. It took me as long to write this as it takes me to fold my laundry and clean my room. Learning French to conversational levels might take as much time as playing through&nbsp;Arkham Asylum and&nbsp;the next Assassin&#8217;s Creed. Useful things to&nbsp;know.<br /><br />Turns out you can&#8217;t store time though. Those few minutes of spare time you have can&#8217;t be put into a time bank and then redeemed for extra spare time in the future. It goes stale very quickly.</div>

A couple of weekends ago, Joliette and I were on holiday in Barcelona, visiting our friends Jamu &amp; Jenn.<br /><br />While we were there, the four of us walked up to the top of Tibidabo, a mountain overlooking Barcelona. We walked to the very top where Joliette and I separated from our hosts to take a closer look at the church. After looking around at its interior a bit, we went outside. I drew Joliette aside underneath some trees away from the crowds, got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.<br /><br />She said yes.<br /><br />And then I started breathing again, and gave her the ring that I had been carrying around like a fool in &#8220;Europe&#8217;s pickpocketing capital&#8221;.<br /><br />Since then, we&#8217;ve told our families, announced on Facebook and are mere hours away from deciding on a date. Wedding planning has begun in earnest. As Joliette&#8217;s family is mostly in America, and mine is mostly in Australia, and we&#8217;re marrying in London, we have our work cut out for us.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

I&#8217;m not a morning person. At all. I really don&#8217;t like waking up, or indeed doing anything before 11am. Sadly, not being possessed of a fortune and thus able to live life at the mellow tempo of my choosing, I have to put up with it.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been doing an experiment to see if I can hate waking up less. The idea is to give up coffee and all other drinks with caffeine and see if I can draw from my own latent energy. After all, most of the &#8220;buzz&#8221; that regular coffee drinkers get is actually the relief of the withdrawal symptoms that they&#8217;ve developed over night. Or so I&#8217;m told.<br /><br />Last week I gradually cut down my coffee drinking from &#8220;way too much&#8221; to &#8220;two shots of espresso&#8221; to &#8220;one shot&#8221; and then to no coffee at all. No tea, no coke, no other sources of caffeine besides the occasional square of dark chocolate.<br /><br />I had major headaches on day two of the &#8220;two shots&#8221; stage, and felt mildly lethargic most of the week. Especially had a great deal of trouble focusing.<br /><br />The weekend was my first &#8220;no coffee&#8221; days. Mild headaches &amp; severe lethargy. No need to focus. Thanks to a very patient Joliette for two great days.<br /><br />This week, the headaches and the lack of focus have been pretty tough. Today I&#8217;ve been headache free but very much craving a coffee as a way to signal, &#8220;right, time to knuckle down &amp; get to it&#8221;. The focus-fog seems to be worst in the late morning and best in the afternoon.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also been going to sleep earlier, although I&#8217;ve been doing more exercise, which may be a part of that.<br /><br />I&#8217;m still waiting for the day when I bounce right out of bed, eager to face the world, and for a day where my brain focuses like it does on caffeine. I&#8217;m hoping the day turns up next week, because I&#8217;m definitely going to have a <i>cortado</i> or three when I&#8217;m in Barcelona.</div>

I&#39;ve never been a coffee (or tea) drinker, never been a morning person and always struggle to get out of bed. Hate to say it, but you might be waiting a long time.<br /><br />However, I do notice the cortisol buzz that my brain produces about 40 mins after I wake up. So if you can get out of bed with the promise of a warm shower, nice brekkie etc, you should have a bit of bounce by the time you&#39;ve &#39;woken up&#39;. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

If you&#39;ve had a whole week worth of headaches, you&#39;re definitely doing the right thing by cutting back a bit.  If I&#39;m overdoing it, the effect seems to be cumulative; eventually I just start waking up every day with a headache.<br /><br />However, I&#39;ve never experienced the miraculous recovery of energy that some of my peers claim to have discovered upon giving up their preferred form of caffeine (be it coffee, tea, or red bull).  Personally, I&#39;ve given up on going caffeine-free.  I <a href="http://chainsawsuit.com/2011/08/12/coffee-for-addicts/" rel="nofollow">really can&#39;t focus the same way</a> without coffee or at least strong tea at some point during the day.  However, a regulated dosage at particular times of day is a huge improvement over &quot;just drink coffee whenever I feel like it&quot;.  And periodic breaks of a week or so bring down my tolerance level so that it has the desired effect again.</div>

I feel for you!  I&#39;ve had to do a similar thing recently and it sucks and is awful and i hate it.  But theres something to be said for natural energy (though I&#39;ve got a bit more freedom than you in that my lack of focus just means I lose chess to Xav more and forget my car keys).<br /><br />Decaf feels cheap, but it helps make up for life without coffee a bit:-)</div>

In my experience, I&#39;ve found that cutting out caffeine altogether didn&#39;t make much of a difference &#8211; not having it after a certain point of the day and getting regular exercise has much more of an effect.<br /><br />That one cup in the morning is, for me, the perfect way to say &quot;okay, time to be awake&quot;.</div>

It&#39;s ok to have coffee, although a lot of coffee can cause damage. Head, stomach, teeth and nerves&#8230;<br />I think the solution for the morning part is quite natural and I discovered it back in Montreal when the sun would show up at 5am&#8230;so at 7am I was feeling like I overslept.<br />Real caffeine would come up 2h after I woke up, at the office, and I&#39;d take like 4 shots of it throughout the whole day.<br />One more fact that helped me a lot was the fact that we would needed to go for a walk to get to the office. So i&#39;d say that when I&#39;m there, I walk for like 8km a day&#8230;which helps a lot.<br />Anyways, start with the sun&#8230;let it wake you up slowly, and then you&#39;re going to start to feel better and need less caffeine.</div>

It used to be that if you asked me which super-power I wanted, I would tell you, &#8220;instantaneous, effortless, accurate, error-free teleportation&#8221;. Something very much like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/">Jumper</a>,&nbsp;except with fewer determined foes and better acting. After all, that would mean no more flights, no more uphill walks, no more being late, no more forgetting things and plenty more holidays.<br /><br />But recently, I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I want to be <i>Video Game Man</i>. I want the super-powers that every video game character actually has that aren&#8217;t even treated as super-powers.<br /><br /><b>Infinite stamina: </b>Practically every video game character can run, jump, climb and fight forever without becoming tired, experiencing fatigue or slowing down in any way. This would make kickboxing much easier.<br /><br /><b>Self-sustaining:</b>&nbsp;No need to eat, drink or sleep. Well, maybe if I got injured I could eat an apple to cure me. Think of the time saved.<br /><br /><b>Pause:</b>&nbsp;When things get too confusing or fast-paced, or when a difficult decision must be made, I could pause and take as much time as I wanted to think about it. Of course, it would only be thinking.<br /><br /><b>Quick save, quick load:</b>&nbsp;Attempt difficult situations over and over again. Accidental death would not be a problem. Negotiations could be optimized. Future knowledge could be used to enhance past decisions.<br /><br /><b>Friend or foe: </b>Know instantly who the bad guys are. No more moral ambiguity for me, thank you very much!<br /><br /><b>Know thyself:</b>&nbsp;Clear knowledge of all of my own capabilities – no more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> for me! – and also of my own status, health, wealth etc. Always obvious what I could improve and how much I could improve.<br /><br /><b>Maps:</b>&nbsp;Always knowing where I am, and where I need to go.<br /><br /><b>Unbreakable: </b>Although I could be injured, it would be impossible to break my limbs, blind me, deafen me, or even slow me down. No possible accident could reduce or remove any of my innate capabilities.<br /><br />Looking over this list, I&#8217;m reminded of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture">The Culture</a>, a utopia designed by Iain M. Banks and the little I know of the <a href="http://gamification.org/wiki/Gamification_Books/Reality_Is_Broken">Reality is Broken</a> meme. Which reminds me, most reader of this blog should look at &#8221;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dings/dont-play-games-with-me-promises-and-pitfalls-of-gameful-design">Don&#8217;t Play Games With Me</a>&#8221;.<br /><br />Oh, and if you&#8217;re able to get me that teleporting gig, I guess I could be convinced to settle for that.</div>

Infinite stamina: Battlefield 1942 had stamina that went down when you jumped or ran; when it was empty, you could do neither. Of course, it regenerates, so it is infinite in a way.<br /><br />Self-sustaining: The Ship. You must eat, drink, and use the toilets to survive. Pathologic requires you to eat, drink, and sleep.<br /><br />Pause: I can&#39;t think of a game where not pausing is a notable, intentional feature.<br /><br />Quick save, quick load: Prince of Persia. Not only did it not have quicksave or quickload, it didn&#39;t allow you to save or load at all&#8211;you had to complete the game in one hour.<br /><br />Friend or foe: Team Fortress 2. The Spy. He&#39;s behind you.<br /><br />Know thyself: I don&#39;t know any games where you don&#39;t know your status and/or abilities as an intentional, significant feature.<br /><br />Maps: Half-Life 2. No map. No explicit direction of where to go. Of course, being largely linear, you don&#39;t have a lot of choice.<br /><br />Unbreakable: Deus Ex. Your arms, legs, head, and torso sustained damage independently. If your right arm was damaged too far, you could no longer hold a weapon. If both legs were damaged too far, you could no longer walk, but only crawl.</div>

Winter is dragging on in London. There&#8217;s a tree outside my window, perhaps I&#8217;ve told you about it before. When I first moved here a year and a half ago, its branches were bare and through the gaps between the ends I could see a dead building made of black and glass and a solid grey sky. It&#8217;s like that now. Every time I look out my window I hope to see flowers budding or leaves growing, telling me that Spring is really here.<br /><br />It&#8217;s odd to care so much about it, and to look for those signs. In Australia, so many plants are evergreen, and you have to be as far south as Tasmania for seasons to mean much. Flower buds and singing birds are the sort of metaphors you read in books and have to be explained to you, in much the way that the rain-in-a-dry-land metaphors in the Bible have to be explained to the British.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve spent the morning replying to personal correspondence, most of which has been sitting in a virtual drawer for months and months. I confess that a part of me saw it as a duty that had to be done, but that part quickly shrivelled once I actually started to re-read and reply to the emails. What I dreaded from a distance as a chore quickly became a pleasure when up close, and I truly am blessed to have such friends.<br /><br />Now there are lazy Sunday chores to do before I&#8217;m off to church. Cleaning, organizing, reviewing lists, making lists and carefully avoiding becoming lost in code, books or video games.</div>

There are a lot of interesting people on Twitter, and it seems like a good way to be part of a broader conversation. I quite like the short format of Facebook status update, so it figures that tweeting should come naturally.<br /><br />The problem is I always slide off Twitter like a sock off a warm glass window (try it sometime!). I just can&#8217;t stick to it. Anyone else had this problem? Is it a tech thing or an attitude thing? Am I better off leaving it alone?</div>

What suddenly got me into using Twitter was attending a developers conference in 2009* where a majority of the other attendees used it. I met a lot of people, talked with them, and got their twitter handles.<br /><br />After the conference was over, this made it much easier to keep in touch with what was going on in this scene. It sort of fit the same general feel as the discussions in the pub every night during the conference: a lot of informal chatter, some excellent discussions, and listening in or weighing in on whatever is relevant or interesting to me.<br /><br />I now use a twitter client on my desktop machine, skimming through tweets every now and again. The group of people I follow has broadened well beyond just Cocoa developers, and into other areas of interest to me.<br /><br />The final thing that clicked for me about it is the asymmetry of the “follow” relationship. I follow people because I’m interested in what they’re saying, but I have no expectation of them following me back. And I unfollow anyone without remorse if I’m no longer interested in their tweets, or they’re tweeting the latest stupid meme too much. I can always peek at their timeline later and follow again if I want to. The asymmetry of this is very different to “friend” relationships on Facebook: partly because those are only reciprocal, and partly because the term “friend” is very loaded, and “unfriending” carries implications of falling out.<br /><br />For me, twitter is like sitting in a huge IRC channel, but with a whitelist instead of a blacklist deciding what I see. And shorter messages.<br /><br />*NSConference, not Europython, though it had the same effect to some extent.</div>

I think the thing to remember about Twitter is that it is for mobile phones, not computers.  But I agree with Tom&#39;s points too.</div>

I think Facebook&#39;s &quot;Top News&quot; functionality is a major lack on Twitter. (Also, a character limit closer to 500 characters would be helpful.)</div>

I just made a twitter comeback for the same reasons you mention, but I can already remember why I left it twice before:<br /><br />1. 140 characters is very restrictive. It&#39;s hard to say anything meaningful.<br /><br />2. The short URLs are scary. Is it only me? It seems completely unnatural to me to click on a link without having any idea where it&#39;s going.<br /><br />3. The volume is hard to manage. Once you start following enough people you get loads of info, and it&#39;s very unbalanced - some users tweet a lot and some hardly at all.<br /><br /><br />I find that using it from the phone (I&#39;m using the Android client - which is really well done) feels better, so I think I might keep it as a phone-only thing (that should also help make sure I don&#39;t waste time I could spend doing useful things on Twitter - I still don&#39;t do anything particularly useful on the phone).</div>

I mentioned a while ago how it felt like I&#8217;d been living in some pretty big times. Since then, subjective time has been torn out of the shoulder socket of habit and things have been in a bit of a mess. A good mess, but a mess nevertheless. There&#8217;s nothing for it but to recount what&#8217;s happened.<div><br /></div><div>Buckets of fun were had over Christmas. I spent the Eve and the Day with Ian and Rowan, two friends from church who shared a wonderfully family-like Christmas with me. Ro even made a stocking with my name on it. I lost every single board game I played, but there was nice port. I also got a chance to have a video call with most of my Tasmanian family. Funny to think that was the first time I saw my parents in over a year.</div><div><br /></div><div>After that, I returned home and played video games for a week solid, while Joliette and practically everyone else were away. <i>Enslaved </i>is very good, and&nbsp;<i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i> is even better, but you probably knew that already.</div><div><br /></div><div>Square-eye fun ended, the new year rolled around and I packed my bags and went to Dallas for three weeks. Now, there are many fine people who live in Dallas, many of whom have been kind to me. But it&#8217;s a hole.</div><div><br /></div><div>Granted, I spent most of the time in a hotel in conference rooms without natural sunlight talking about some of the more arcane aspects of distributed open source software development, but even so, it&#8217;s not one of my top ten favourite cities. In each of <i>those</i>&nbsp;cities, you do not need a car to cross the street.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first week in Dallas was spent doing the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">single geekiest thing</a> that has ever been done in that city. Our old group from Tassie was re-formed, along with special guest James Whelan. My monk kicked arse.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eventually, after both play and work were done, I left Dallas (yay!) and went home to London. Jetlag has thrown the time out of joint in a different way, although if I had more discipline I would recover faster. Returning to kickboxing after six weeks out of practice is an exercise in humility, as was watching some of the clips from my grading session.</div><div><br /></div><div>J &amp; I went to see Hamlet on Wednesday. It&#8217;s my first time watching it on stage, and the first performance J has ever seen. I was very pleased. I had forgotten just how good it is. The production emphasised the constant surveillance of the Danish court, Kinnear played the Dane as a hyper-sensitive introvert who shields himself with wit, and <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/59912/company-members/david-calder.html">Calder</a>&nbsp;did an excellent Polonius.</div><div><br /></div><div>Driving goes well. After warming up a bit I seemed to be as good as I was six weeks ago. Apparently, I&#8217;ve just got to master maneuvres, roundabouts and the motorway before I&#8217;m ready for my test.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, did my first ever yoga class yesterday. I was expecting it to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very flexible. It turned out to be challenging because I&#8217;m not very strong. I&#8217;m surprised that the male yoga practitioners I know don&#8217;t look substantially beefier, to be honest. Also, I hadn&#8217;t expected to break a sweat. Nice that there wasn&#8217;t much of a &#8220;spiritual&#8221; element to that, as there are certain teachings that I cannot submit to nor appear to submit to.</div><div><br /></div><div>That&#8217;s it, I think. Hope all is going well with you.</div></div>

We&#8217;ve had some big times over the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, my mind was focused on grading, on the day when I would be tested to see if I would be awarded a blue belt for kick-boxing. Everything reminded me of grading, or was bad because it might harm my chances, or was good because it would help, or was too big to think about before grading. All plans and thoughts passed through the nexus of that cold Sunday morning in a large indoor dojo.<br /><br />On the day, I felt this strange mix of confidence and uncertainty. I was healthy, I had trained hard, I knew all of the techniques, my teachers said I was ready and I <i>really</i>&nbsp;wanted that belt, but&nbsp;I had never done anything this physically demanding or &#8220;sporty&#8221; before and I didn&#8217;t know if some rebel part of my mind would tell me to quit half-way through.<br /><br />The grading was hard, but I passed. I&#8217;ve been awarded my blue belt, and I have to say that there are few achievements of which I am more proud.<br /><br />If all I&#8217;d done over the last two weeks had been to get this belt, it would have been a big two weeks.<br /><br />But of course, I also went ice skating. It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve been in ice skates on a rink, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve actually <i>skated</i>&nbsp;in those ice skates on a rink. It&#8217;s fun, but it&#8217;s stressful in the same way learning to drive in London is stressful, something is always veering out in front of you daring you to maim it with your beginner&#8217;s ignorance.<br /><br />I have also done my woefully late Christmas shopping, a great Pyrrhic victory in which I lost hours and sterling and self-respect. I wish I had a better knack of demonstrating affection through the giving of gifts.<br /><br />Christmas shopping, ice skating, kick-boxing, what else? Oh yes, Barcelona. Joliette and I spent the week there with friends and it was wonderful. I got a little ill during the middle of it, which meant that we lolled about indoors as much as we strolled about outside. Even so, we saw some great things.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_familia">Sagrada Familía</a>&nbsp;has been renovated since I last saw it. All of the interior scaffolding has been taken down and inside it&#8217;s almost complete. To describe it would only be to belittle it. We were speechless and amazed for ten full minutes after we crossed the threshold.<br /><br />There&#8217;s more, of course. Over the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve walked among ancient wonders, seen Herbie Hancock play live, heard beautiful and pure voices sing carols at the Royal Albert Hall, had an actual decent plate of eggs benedict in London and drank a mug of the most chocolatey hot chocolate that ever was.<br /><br />Sadly, I never got to try the panther milk.</div>

Nothing wrong with commenting on an old post, especially given the rate I post here.<br /><br />1) Thank you :)<br /><br />2) Ahh yes. It&#39;s not a proper French dining experience until you&#39;ve been thoroughly patronized by the waiter.<br /><br />3) A charming young lady with whom I&#39;ve been spending a great deal of time.</div>

Yes, yes, yes, commenting on an old post. But:<br /><br />1) Congrats on the belt. Awesomeness.<br /><br />2) The most chocolatey hot chocolate that ever was is from Les Deux Magots in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Would go beautifully with churros, but the waiters might look at you with more disdain than usual.<br /><br />3) Joliette?</div>

Barcelona.  It was essentially dipping chocolate for churros.  We both finished ours, but I suspect that if we hadn&#39;t it would have solidified.</div>

Sounds like you&#39;re enjoying life jml - good to hear.<br /><br />But was that hot chocolate in London or Barcelona? I bought a hot chocolate in Barcelona recently and it was so chocalatey that I couldn&#39;t actually finish (which is something!). To my surprise, when it cooled, it solidified!</div>

Anyone else notice how December has sneaked up on us this year? Normally it just stands there, proud, forbidding and distant, waiting for us to come to it. This time though, December has thrown off its gaudy robes, donned a black ski mask and starting running silently through bushes and backflipping over rooftops &nbsp;in order to trap us in a <i>stealth ninja attack</i>.<br /><br />I have a theory. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t actually think December is some kind of rogue assassin months with training in the mystical arts – that would be silly. &nbsp;I think that the G8 has been secretly selling off bits of October to the Chinese government.<br /><br />Think about it. Everyone knows that October has thirty-one days, because otherwise there wouldn&#8217;t be a Halloween, but it always <i>feels</i>&nbsp;like it should be a thirty day month. &nbsp;Winter came early this year. Why? Because there were actually fewer days in October to separate it from Summer. &nbsp;A day here, a day there, sliced off, packaged and sent to China where they use it to dissipate some of the excess energy from their over-heated economy.<br /><br />All I&#8217;m saying is, don&#8217;t be surprised when next year you are sitting back, feeling all smug and self-congratulatory in your August armchair and then BAM! it&#8217;s mid-November and you are wondering what just happened to the year and trying to figure out when you&#8217;ll find time to do your Christmas shopping.<br /><br />Don&#8217;t ask me how it works, I&#8217;m not a Communist.</div>
