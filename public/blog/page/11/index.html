After dispatching my missive on the ethereal winds, I must confess I had little hope. Although my faith in my readers is incalculable, my wanderings have taken me far, and I had begun to believe that I had seen all that has been given to mortal eye to see, and that my readers would be merely recounting tales already well known to me.<br /><br />But sing a new song, O doubting heart! Through a variety of means &#8211; some humble, some ingenious &#8211; you dear readers have sent word of old books for which the dust of age only strengthens the potency of the enchantments within, like some secret wine. I&#8217;ve heard of other books too, newer perhaps, their charms accordingly more fallible but perhaps not more feeble.<br /><br />Two books were commended to me, and two names without books commended also. That the numbering of the books matched the numbering of the names seemed auspicious to me. Of the books, the first is called &#8220;The Book of the New Sun&#8221; as written by Gene Wolfe; the second hight &#8220;The Gift&#8221; by Alison Croggan, an author from my own country. My hopes for the first are high, for the second, low. Though a prophet is seldom honored in his own town, my bigoted heart says an author is perhaps too honored in her own country.<br /><br />Two names without books were given. Though there are books to the names, the names were given to me without books and without books they shall be passed on. The names are Charles de Lint and George Macdonald. The second name was given to me by someone who has not read any of my missives, but who has certainly read me.<br /><br />I have found some of these tomes, and in due course I shall venture into them. Even when all are read and gone, my quest will not be over. Your help, dear reader, is needed now more than ever. I await your reply with eagerness and indeed, hope.<br /><br />I am etc.,</div>

I read a Charles de Lint (<i>The Little Country</i>, maybe?) when I was about 14, and I remember quite liking it.  I don&#39;t entirely trust my 14-year-old self&#39;s sense of taste, though&#8230;<br /><br />(Random fact: around about that time I was also reading quite a lot of Anne McCaffery, mainly the Dragonriders of Pern novels.)</div>

<div>The Australian national anthem is called Advance Australia Fair. The anthem has two verses, Advance Australia Fair has six or three depending on who you ask. In almost every state and sporting occasion, only one verse is sung.</div><div><br />There are some occasions where singing both verses is required. No one likes those.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is about the second verse of the anthem. I&#8217;ve already <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2009/05/advance-australia-fair-part-1.html">commented on the first verse</a>.<br /><dl><dt>Beneath our radiant Southern Cross</dt><br /><dd>The Southern Cross is a constellation that features on the Australian flag and on the sky in the Southern hemisphere. And the Kiwi flag. It&#8217;s not really <i>our</i> Southern cross, since I&#8217;m pretty sure you can see it in<br />South Africa and the Falkland Islands. That said, it is beautiful, and it does radiate.</dd><br /><dt>We&#8217;ll toil with hearts and hands;</dt><br /><dd>We&#8217;ll work together and we&#8217;ll like it.<br /></dd><br /><dt>To make this Commonwealth of ours renowned of all the lands;</dt><dd><br />To make Australia famous. We achieved fame domestically quite some time ago, so now our anthem&#8217;s ambition is to make it famous elsewhere. &#8220;Of all the lands&#8221; either means that Australia ought to be the most famous country in the world or that Australia ought to be famous in every single other country. I think we&#8217;re doing pretty well at this, to be honest.<br /></dd><br /><dt>For those who&#8217;ve come across the seas</dt>  <dd><br />Either:<ul> <li>everyone in Australia apart from the Aboriginals, who probably walked</li><br /><li>British people</li><br /><li>those whom we would now call immigrants<br /></li>  </ul></dd></dl><dl><dt>We&#8217;ve boundless plains to share;</dt><br /><dd>You can stay in the middle of the desert.</dd><br /><dt>With courage let us all combine</dt><dd><br /></dd> <dd>Sadly, not like Voltron.

I&#8217;d like to point out that no one sings in &#8220;strains&#8221; any more, and that I&#8217;ve filled out tax returns that are more poetically evocative.</dd><br /><dt>Advance Australia fair</dt><br /><dd>A tad repetitve, no?</dd></dl>To be honest, I prefer the Seekers song.</div></div>

Recently, I&#8217;ve been disappointed to notice myself becoming more patriotic. I don&#8217;t know if this is a result of aging, or a consequence of frequent international travel. I don&#8217;t know whether I should do anything about it, nor even what I would do if I wanted to change.<br /><br />The patriotic fever reached its rabid peak the other day when my rational self caught the other part singing Australia&#8217;s national anthem. I stopped immediately, of course, but the damage had been done. Perhaps the moment of insanity had be triggered by a conversation I had with a friend about immigration and just who we should let into the country. We disagreed.<br /><br />Since then, my mind has been wandering. I&#8217;ve been thinking about a New Australian who desires to indoctrinate themselves our national values, and how they might approach the national anthem, &#8220;Advance Australia Fair&#8221;.<br /><br />To help them along, and maybe to go some way toward resolving the disagreement with my friend, I&#8217;ve decided to go through the Australian national anthem right here, on this blog, line by line.<br /><br />It&#8217;s rather a pompous song, written in a mode of &#8220;poetic&#8221; English that has never been idiomatic and never had any currency among actual poets. Even with my new-found nascent patriotism, I can&#8217;t bring myself to actually <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> it.<br /><br />Here it is:<br /><dl><dt>Australians all let us rejoice,</dt><br /><dd>Be happy Australians!</dd><br /><dt>For we are young and free;</dt><br /><dd>Because our country was founded relatively recently and we have many political freedoms, such as being allowed by our government to watch almost any film and read almost any book.<br /><br /></dd><dt>We&#8217;ve golden soil</dt><br /><dd>Literally, &#8220;we have yellow dirt&#8221;. Either means that Australia is full of the mineral gold, or that our soil is rich. The latter would imply that Australia is an agriculturally prosperous country, and I believe is the sense of the phrase. Note that Australia is the second driest continent in the world, after Antarctica.</dd><br /><dt>and wealth for toil;</dt><br /><dd>If you work hard in Australia, you&#8217;ll get rich.</dd><br /><dt>Our home is girt by sea;</dt><dd><p>&#8220;Girt&#8221; is a rare word for &#8220;surrounded&#8221;. A girdle girts. &#8220;Girth&#8221; is a mostly disused word meaning &#8220;circumference&#8221;. If a thing follows the circumference of another thing, the first thing can be said to &#8220;gird&#8221; the second thing. The second thing is &#8220;girt by&#8221; the first thing. If it spoke plainly, this line would say that Australia is one or more islands.</p> <p>The logic up to this point is that Australians should be happy since we&#8217;re rich, happy, free, young, economically just and &#8230; a bunch of islands. New Zealand, Madagascar, Japan, Great Britain, Iceland and Tonga have never considered this a particular reason for rejoicing. I&#8217;m not exactly sure why Australia does.</p> </dd> <dt>Our land abounds in nature&#8217;s gifts</dt><br /><dd>Our country is full of things we didn&#8217;t put there.</dd><br /><dt>Of beauty rich and rare;</dt><br /><dd>The natural things in our country have a rich beauty, as opposed to a minimalistic beauty, and there are few other things as beautiful as the natural things in Australia. Of course, Australia <i>abounds</i> in them, so they can&#8217;t be that rare.</dd><br /><dt>Let history&#8217;s page in every stage, advance Australia fair</dt><br /><dd>Every time anyone writes about stuff that happened, it should promote the cause of the Australian nation, which is beautiful.</dd><br /><dt>In joyful strains then let us sing</dt><br /><dd>Let&#8217;s sing happy melodies. The composer of the anthem interpreted this metaphorically.</dd><br /><dt>&#8220;Advance Australia Fair&#8221;</dt><br /><dd>&#8220;Australia Fair&#8221; isn&#8217;t a reference to the White Australia policy (I think), but rather a tired &#8220;poetic&#8221; way of saying &#8220;Australia the Beautiful&#8221;. My unsubstantiated hunch is that &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; was already taken, and that it&#8217;s much easier to rhyme with &#8220;fair&#8221; than &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.</dd><dd><br /></dd><dd>Unfortunately, I have no idea what it means.<br /><p> To <i>advance</i> Australia is a nebulous concept, no matter how often we insist that it&#8217;s beautiful. It means literally &#8220;move Australia forward&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t really illuminate the author&#8217;s intent. It can&#8217;t mean move Australia forward <i>spatially</i>: that would be impossible to achieve and to define, no matter how full of zeal one was. It probably doesn&#8217;t mean forward <i>technologically</i> either, since none of the other lyrics acknowledge technology&#8217;s existence. It&#8217;s not morally either, since the author seems to think we&#8217;ve already arrived. It&#8217;s probably either wealth or political influence, but that&#8217;s only speculation.<br /></p> </dd></dl>There you have it. Nothing that bad, but nothing that good either. Mostly it&#8217;s just a meaningless ditty to bang out too slowly and too sincerely at sporting events.<br /><br />At a stretch, you could say that it summarizes something of the Australian spirit. We&#8217;re generally pretty happy and relaxed, united by being in a pretty good country and we&#8217;re lousy at poetry.<br /><br />It&#8217;s still better than God Save The Queen.<br /><br />Next post, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2009/06/advance-australia-fair-part-2.html">next verse</a>.</div>

Hey! from an old xenophobe who doesn&#39;t mind the words of the first stanza of the national anthem. <br />Advance in this context means &quot;make progress in life&quot;. There are plenty of examples of nations that aren&#39;t doing that<br />&quot;golden&quot; often has a dictionary meaning of &quot;inestimable value&quot; (a golden opportunity)<br />And if you think our system of pay for work is a problem, look around the world    <br />To understand the significance of &quot;girt by sea&quot;, think about the defence implications when it was written and the actual implications in Australian 20th century history- the comparison with Britain and the contrast with the mayhem that came from European land border wars <br />For gifts &quot;rich and rare&quot;  take the second dictionary meaning of rare, &quot;Splendid, excellent, fine&quot; <br />But truly, if you think the first stanza is mediocre 19th century poetry of a certain style, cop this lot of the rest of the original words written in 1879<br /><br />When gallant Cook from Albion sailed.<br />To trace wide oceans o&#39;er.<br />True British courage bore him on.<br />Til he landed on our shore<br />Then here he raised Old England&#39;s flag.<br />The standard of the brave.<br />With all her faults we love her still.<br />Britannia rules the wave<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.<br /><br />When other nations of the globe.<br />Behold us from afar,<br />We&#39;ll rise to high renown<br />And shine like our glorious southern star<br />From English soil and Fatherland<br />Scotia and Erin fair<br />Let all combine with heart and hand<br />To Advance Australia fair.<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.<br /><br />Should foreign foe e&#39;er sight our coast.<br />Or dare a foot to land.<br />We&#39;ll rouse to arms like sires of yore<br />To guard our native strand.<br />Britannia then shall surely know,<br />Though oceans roll between<br />Her sons in fair Australia&#39;s land<br />Still keep their courage green.<br />In joyful strains then let us sing<br />Advance Australia Fair.</div>

The impending xenophobia of old age scares me. I don&#39;t know where it comes from, but I&#39;ve recently been thinking once again how much better the whole world would be if all international relations were handled by children between the ages of 4 and 10. Adults suck, they&#39;re too set in their ways to accept other people&#39;s.<br /><br />As for our national anthem, it really isn&#39;t much, and it&#39;s hard to be proud of it as such, but then, I guess it&#39;s not so far off the mark in terms of describing Australia - well, other than the natures gifts bit&#8230; the anthem never mentions that they&#39;re beautiful, but they all want to kill you! :p<br /><br />As for &quot;advancing&quot; Australia the beautiful, I guess it means &quot;put forward&quot;, which you can do in the form of &quot;stick it to them&quot;. Which does explain the fact that we really only associate our anthem with sport!</div>

Well, I have some advantages here: as you say GSTQ is awful, so I&#39;m not likely to hum that, and the NZ anthem hasn&#39;t wormed its way into my brain.<br /><br />Of course the only good national anthem is la Marseillaise, and that&#39;s incredibly xenophobic and violent even by the standards of national anthems.</div>

Ah &quot;girt&quot;.  I rate the rest as pretty mediocre, but &quot;girt&quot; has always delighted me with it&#39;s ridiculous quaintness.<br /><br />Getting on to the second verse will be a better effort than about 90% of Australians.</div>

Dear Reader,<br /><br />When I wrote to you <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2009/06/returned-from-book-shop.html">some weeks ago</a>, I alluded to my quest and promised to tell you of it in my next post. You have certainly noticed that I have not kept my word, and I nurse only the bitter hope that the pain of yet another broken promise has become dull, now that you are accustomed to my small betrayals. Please allow me now to tell you of my quest, however belatedly, and I beg that you keep the doors of your heart open when I ask for your help.<br /><br />My quest, you might say, is for magic. Not the devilish magic of dark ritual nor yet the uncanny transcendence of Eastern sage, but rather that magic that was called &#8220;sub-creation&#8221; by one of its masters. Plainly, I mean that I seek books of Fantasy.<br /><br />Perhaps you might laugh now and say &#8220;It is so easy, Jonathan! Why do you call such a trifling task a <span style="font-style: italic;">quest</span>?&#8221;. Yet I crave a moment&#8217;s indulgence wherein I can make my difficulties plain. If you must laugh, let your laughter be contained within and for my sake present a solemn exterior as I tell you my story.<br /><br />I have read hundreds of books. Although I&#8217;ve not kept track, the number might well pass into the thousands. Many of those books have been books of fantasy. I have always loved them, and despite the numerous social stigma attached to them, I love them even today.<br /><br />The full tale of my readings would be far too long for this missive. Suffice it to say that after falling deep into Tolkien, I read whatever I could find, no matter how poor it was. As I grew older, my tastes matured and I began to demand more of the books I read. It has thus become harder to find books of fantasy that I actually enjoy reading. Further, since I&#8217;ve read so many books already, the pool from which to draw them grows ever shallower.<br /><br />Dear, dear reader, I must find books of magic that I have not read that are not awful. Well-written books with rich, full characters and deep forests of imagination. My own resources are failing me and I must turn to you for help. Where are these books? I must have them now!<br /><br />I apologize for the length of this post. In my defense, I can so only that my quest has been longer. Please do not let me fail now.<br /><br />Yours etc.,</div>

Ok, then. I can say avoid Fiona McIntosh, and Brent Weeks might not be up to scratch. Michael Marshall Smith&#39;s Only Forward is part sci-fi part fantasy in a way that doesn&#39;t suck, and is a good book besides.</div>

I&#39;ll leave the zenith till last, shall I?<br /><br />The nadir is obviously Terry Goodkind&#39;s &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. I do not wished to be preached at nor patronized by any book containing dominatrices clad in red leather wielding magic pain whips.<br /><br />As an aside, although I do love the serial form of fantasy, I&#39;d prefer recommendations for series that are already finished.<br /><br />A minimum acceptable book might well be <i>Magician</i> by Raymond Feist. Not particularly well written, but not that bad either. Not particularly magical, but certainly a fun adventure. <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> is another along similar lines.<br /><br />I do not believe there is a zenith, but there are books that have climbed so high that all that remains is a malnourished sherpa and a legend.<br /><br />Those that come to mind: <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, <i>The Silmarillion</i>, <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, almost anything Robin Hobb has written, <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> (minus the gratuitous), the <i>Sandman</i> series, the <i>Lankhmar</i> tales, <i>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</i>, <i>The Broken Sword</i>, many of Dunsany&#39;s short stories, <i>Nine Princes in Amber</i>, <i>The Fionovar Tapestry</i> (at least on first reading), <i>Tales from the Dying Earth</i>.<br /><br />None of these books is perfect. Some are more magical than others, some are better written than others. Yet they are all books of magic that I have loved.<br /><br />I hope that helps.</div>

I think a zenith, a nadir, and a minimum acceptable would be helpful here. Otherwise, who knows what might happen?</div>

I recently finished reading <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">Chris Guillebeau</a>&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/">279 Days to Overnight Success</a>&#8221;. It&#8217;s all about how to succeed as a professional blogger. You might want to read it too, since it&#8217;s quite interesting.<br /><br />It does, however have this unfortunate section where Guillebeau tries to describe <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/">Havi Brooks</a>&#8217; work on <a href="http://www.fluentself.com/blog/">The Fluent Self</a>. The purpose of her blog is hard to grasp at first, he laments. Convinced that there was <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span> there, he visits Brooks&#8217; blog again and again, until at last he shouts his euraka:<br /><blockquote>I finally &#8220;got&#8221; it: Havi helps people rewrite their bad patterns and turn them into good ones.</blockquote>Crystal clear.</div>

Oh, drat you for reminding me about Kinokuniya, I&#39;m going to Sydney in a couple of weeks&#8230; last time i felt it best I didn&#39;t get into the books, having already spent close to $200 in the stationary section!!! I could have done without ever being told that shop exists!!<br />Obviously Ellison Hawker is officially the best book shop, cos it&#39;s in Hobart and the staff are great, but otherwise Kinokuniya totally counts as the best shop going!! :)</div>

Thanks for the tip.<br /><br />Most of these books are ones I&#39;ve wanted to buy for months now, so I&#39;m OK with the amateur tag :)<br /><br />That said, I was disappointed when I walked out and realized that none of the authors were new to me.</div>

Meh, an okay list for an amateur ;).<br /><br />Try Roberto Bolano. His 2666 might be your new Infinite Jest type book.</div>

Sounds like a good pack of books.<br /><br />I love Ursula Le Guin. And if she knew I existed, she&#39;d love me too.<br /><br />I&#39;m reading &quot;Lowboy&quot; by John Wray atm. It&#39;s main character is a paranoid schizophrenic. Well written one.<br /><br />Oh, and I do have plans to read Infinite Jest these holidays.</div>
