As part of a new lifestyle experiment, I&#8217;ve tweaked my router to block my laptop from all net access after 8pm.<br /><br />The idea isn&#8217;t to put a total ban on all nocturnal net activity, but rather to make a space for other things in my life. I&#8217;ll still be available for scheduled calls and such, of course, but no unplanned activity.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll know if it works if I deng about less online, and become more focused in my evenings. I&#8217;ll give the experiment a couple of months at least.</div>

It sounds similar, but not quite the same, as what I&#8217;d like to accomplish by spending less time on the &#8216;net. Focus of that sort is definitely part of it, but there&#8217;s also just a draggy feeling associated with every moment of boredom being salved with a quick email check. I get the same thing (much more rapidly) if I play too many computer games, oddly. Not so much an inferred inability to experience the present moment (as in &#8220;where has my time gone this week? oh yeah&#8230;&#8221;), or guilt but an emotional reaction rather like having eaten too much.</div>

Basically, being on the net bleeds into the evenings, and I&#8217;m never doing just one thing, because I&#8217;m always checking my email as well.<BR/><BR/>http://life.mumak.net/2008/10/attention.html gets at what I mean, I think.</div>

What is &#8220;more focussed&#8221; here? I am, coincidently, experimenting with something similar, not for focus, but for happiness.</div>

I&#8217;m really, really thinking of getting myself a smart phone. Something that I can carry around that has a good calendar, a good address book, a good todo list manager and a way to quickly make notes that I can easily process later.<br /><br />Maybe it doesn&#8217;t have to be a phone. Maybe it can be a separate device. I don&#8217;t know.<br /><br />I would get an iPhone, but I&#8217;m currently on a plan. The Android phone (marketed as HTC Dream in Australia) looks kind of cool, but&#8230; uhh&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t look like I can buy one outright.<br /><br />Whatever happened to <span style="font-style: italic;">owning</span> things?</div>

EULA!!<BR/><BR/>Ownership and computers have been separating for a very long time.<BR/>Ownership in general is in decline. The banks own most of the houses, &quot;rich people&quot; own the rest (or the banks do) so we can pay them weekly to live in them. You don&#39;t own your phone unless you&#39;re prepaid (in which case you don&#39;t own the right to make calls at any time, only if you&#39;ve paid for credit for that month!). You CAN own your car, but chances are if you do it&#39;s &gt;15 years old and no other bugger wants it.<BR/>You own your clothes, but similar story - not many people want them once you&#39;re over them. Ditto appliances.<BR/>You DO own your computer (unless you do the Harvey norman thing), but you don&#39;t *really* own anything on it unless you wrote it yourself. But then, someone else still has the IP for the OS, and hell, for the chip underneath it too.<BR/><BR/>But then, do you actually NEED to own anything other than the shirt on your back? sure it&#39;d be nice, but I guess not strictly speaking, essential. And that&#39;s where EULAs come in&#8230; bastards reserving the right to be bastards one day.<BR/>And really, that&#39;s what a phone contract is.</div>

I was given Newton&#8217;s Principia, had a bad morning, went to uni and formatted a pile of disks, failed to fix my bike wheel, messed around on facebook, solved some special relativity problems, watched some tv, and generally wished I could be outside getting fit instead of inside doing work.<BR/>But then, that&#8217;s what I do basically every weekend. :)<BR/>(and at least it&#8217;s That Time yet so there was no marking and no hockey umpiring!)<BR/><BR/>Sounds like you had a good weekend :)</div>

Sam &amp; I spent Valentine&#39;s day having the first lazy Saturday since we got back from Christmas holidays.<BR/><BR/>This involved a long lie-in, followed by a fried breakfast, followed by some more lazing around.<BR/><BR/>It was the best weekend in some time.</div>

Last week, Paul preached on <a href="http://www.cbtb.org.au/media/bibletalks/james_119-27/">James 1:19-27</a>. Shows what you can do in under half an hour.<br /><br />It&#8217;s addressed, naturally, to a church-going audience. Readers who aren&#8217;t Christians might find it interesting, if not quite as affecting.</div>

I saw the trailer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span> last night, and I have to admit that it looks pretty good.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />If you are capable of reading, I strongly urge you to read the book before the film comes out. This isn&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Rings</span>, it&#8217;s a graphic novel of under 400 pages. If you stick a copy in your bathroom you&#8217;ll have it read inside a week.<br /><br />Please.</div>

Damn straight!  Despite my better judgement, the Watchmen movie excites me.<BR/><BR/>But there&#8217;s absolutely no way that it&#8217;ll be as good as the graphic novel.  Go read it, everyone!</div>

Indeed, I think this is excellent and insightful. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all points though.<BR/>Specifically the very first one (which I don&#8217;t have now because I&#8217;m back in this window!), something about everything having a simple explanation&#8230; Didn&#8217;t Einstein say something like that?! (ie why a lot of Quantum Theory is wrong!).. I know they mean it in an entirely different way, but I do believe, deep down, that things, physical processes, are fundamentally explicable. Well, until you hit &#8220;God&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think the Big Bang is easily explained.<BR/>Maybe that makes me American :p<BR/><BR/>I also agree with you, it probably is a generally Anglo thing&#8230; though the last set of points I think mean it does perhaps apply a little more to America - because it&#8217;s that strange warped (imho) view of Christianity that gives those beliefs. I don&#8217;t believe a lot of things (particularly political!), but by tagging yourself Christian people think you do. Where you have somewhere where EVERYONE is meant to believe those things (regardless of whether they do), this culture of right, wrong and retribution then grows.<BR/>I don&#8217;t know.</div>

Hmm&#8230; not good :(<BR/>I suppose the other option might be to install small gps tracking devices, or more simply, magnets to all these things, and walk around with either a gps tracker thingy, OR a whacking great magnet covered in essential items :)<BR/><BR/>I guess a better idea would be to not be stressed! :)</div>

Hmm&#8230; the breakages happen, but a fair bit of this is a worry :-/<BR/><BR/>To do some advertising, Pacsafe, which you can get from Snowgum, etc., make neat secure but handy bags. That might fix some of the problems&#8230; <BR/><BR/>I don&#8217;t know. I have a friend who seems to lose stuff a lot. I know she loses more than she says, as well, because we&#8217;ve been camping/travelling with them, and every time we&#8217;ve packed up a campsite or room for them while they&#8217;ve been getting the child-seat stuff together, we&#8217;ve always found a sock or a shirt or whatever.<BR/>I&#8217;ve lost about 3 things in my whole life (excluding breakages)&#8230; did miss a flight, but that was because Aidan and I managed to book on different days (same flight number and time!!).<BR/>I&#8217;m pretty sure the difference between me and my friend is that I have an obsession with/fear of losing stuff, so I&#8217;m always stupidly careful and double check everything most of the time.<BR/>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend OCD though! The solution is not always better than the problem! :)</div>

Ignoring the ones that are problems with money management, you must be due for investment in some kind of optimal bag solution. Should you find one, a demonstration would be good.</div>
