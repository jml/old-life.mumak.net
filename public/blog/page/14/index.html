Last week, Paul preached on <a href="http://www.cbtb.org.au/media/bibletalks/james_119-27/">James 1:19-27</a>. Shows what you can do in under half an hour.<br /><br />It&#8217;s addressed, naturally, to a church-going audience. Readers who aren&#8217;t Christians might find it interesting, if not quite as affecting.</div>

I saw the trailer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Watchmen</span> last night, and I have to admit that it looks pretty good.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />If you are capable of reading, I strongly urge you to read the book before the film comes out. This isn&#8217;t <span style="font-style: italic;">Lord of the Rings</span>, it&#8217;s a graphic novel of under 400 pages. If you stick a copy in your bathroom you&#8217;ll have it read inside a week.<br /><br />Please.</div>

Damn straight!  Despite my better judgement, the Watchmen movie excites me.<BR/><BR/>But there&#8217;s absolutely no way that it&#8217;ll be as good as the graphic novel.  Go read it, everyone!</div>

Mikey and I are going to watch Wolverine when it is released.<BR/><BR/>WOLVERINE.<BR/><BR/>I will watch Transporter 3 and I will most likely be pleasantly surprised. The ending of the first one was super-disappointing.</div>

Indeed, I think this is excellent and insightful. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all points though.<BR/>Specifically the very first one (which I don&#8217;t have now because I&#8217;m back in this window!), something about everything having a simple explanation&#8230; Didn&#8217;t Einstein say something like that?! (ie why a lot of Quantum Theory is wrong!).. I know they mean it in an entirely different way, but I do believe, deep down, that things, physical processes, are fundamentally explicable. Well, until you hit &#8220;God&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think the Big Bang is easily explained.<BR/>Maybe that makes me American :p<BR/><BR/>I also agree with you, it probably is a generally Anglo thing&#8230; though the last set of points I think mean it does perhaps apply a little more to America - because it&#8217;s that strange warped (imho) view of Christianity that gives those beliefs. I don&#8217;t believe a lot of things (particularly political!), but by tagging yourself Christian people think you do. Where you have somewhere where EVERYONE is meant to believe those things (regardless of whether they do), this culture of right, wrong and retribution then grows.<BR/>I don&#8217;t know.</div>

Hmm&#8230; not good :(<BR/>I suppose the other option might be to install small gps tracking devices, or more simply, magnets to all these things, and walk around with either a gps tracker thingy, OR a whacking great magnet covered in essential items :)<BR/><BR/>I guess a better idea would be to not be stressed! :)</div>

Hmm&#8230; the breakages happen, but a fair bit of this is a worry :-/<BR/><BR/>To do some advertising, Pacsafe, which you can get from Snowgum, etc., make neat secure but handy bags. That might fix some of the problems&#8230; <BR/><BR/>I don&#8217;t know. I have a friend who seems to lose stuff a lot. I know she loses more than she says, as well, because we&#8217;ve been camping/travelling with them, and every time we&#8217;ve packed up a campsite or room for them while they&#8217;ve been getting the child-seat stuff together, we&#8217;ve always found a sock or a shirt or whatever.<BR/>I&#8217;ve lost about 3 things in my whole life (excluding breakages)&#8230; did miss a flight, but that was because Aidan and I managed to book on different days (same flight number and time!!).<BR/>I&#8217;m pretty sure the difference between me and my friend is that I have an obsession with/fear of losing stuff, so I&#8217;m always stupidly careful and double check everything most of the time.<BR/>I wouldn&#8217;t recommend OCD though! The solution is not always better than the problem! :)</div>

Not sure how any of these problems are with money management.<BR/><BR/>An optimal bag would be nice, but I don&#8217;t think that would tackle the root cause.</div>

Ignoring the ones that are problems with money management, you must be due for investment in some kind of optimal bag solution. Should you find one, a demonstration would be good.</div>

That&#8217;s hardly fair! A blog is for you to disseminate your opinions, you can hardly just post a question without saying anything about what you think. No play fair! :)<BR/><BR/>I think many of those are worryingly true, I guess all are true to some extent.<BR/>I think the purpose of school it to give everyone the same grounding in reading and writing - so that they are more standardised in their base abilities than they were if everyone were educated by their parents, but also because it is more efficient for one person to teach 20 children than for each mother to teach a couple. I suppose that is where schools come from - not the other things, but simply the efficiency of one person doing the teaching while everyone else can get on with other duties.<BR/>As for what it&#8217;s evolved into today and why do we have schools now&#8230; yeah, I guess I&#8217;d agree with the author on all those points. It seems a twisted and depressing thing, but there are many social psychology arguments for why homogenisation  to some extent etc is necessary.<BR/><BR/>ElFishski knows more about this than I do, but I don&#8217;t know if he reads your blog. *shrug*</div>

I read a little bit of <span style="font-style: italic;">Making It All Work</span> last night. The first few pages are way too self-important and religious-sounding, which makes GTD look even more like a cult than it did before. Reading it, I could hear Anthony Baxter shouting &#8220;It&#8217;s just a todo list&#8221; in my ears.<br /><br />One thing that stood out: <span style="font-style: italic;">drag</span>. The opposite of <span style="font-style: italic;">flow</span>. The thing that saps fun and life from creative endeavours. It&#8217;s the garbage bin with the stuck lid, the test suite that takes thirty minutes to run, the blunt knife, the scratch on the DVD, the squeal of feedback during your talk.<br /><br />Drag disrupts concentration and distracts you from the thing that you are aiming for. Like its physical namesake, it turns useful energy into wasteful heat.<br /><br />Get rid of it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:78%;">(Ok, so it&#8217;s pretty hard to write about this stuff and not sound cultish. Kool-aid anyone?)</span></div>

Alex, :)<BR/><BR/>ddaa, it&#8217;s mostly a problem of communication. When I have something good I want to share with others (like GTD or coffee or whatever), if I sound cultish, they immediately become defensive. This means that fewer good things are shared, which makes me sad.<BR/><BR/>Now you&#8217;ve got me thinking about the difference between the irrational (or is it pre-rational or extra-rational) &#8220;this code is ugly&#8221;, and the irrational &#8220;David Koresh is Lord&#8221;. Hmm.</div>

Is &#8220;sounding cultish&#8221; really a problem?<BR/><BR/>Great programmers live in a world where there is Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, Beautiful and Ugly.<BR/><BR/>The ability to see Ugliness in code or Drag in the David Allen sense for what it is requires <A HREF="http://my.opera.com/alex_boly/blog/a-theory-about-common-sense" REL="nofollow">common sense</A>. You can explain why it&#8217;s bad, but you cannot convey exactly how bleeding bad it is.<BR/><BR/>So it is not surprising that Allen ends up sounding <EM>cultish</EM>, in the same way that great programmers sometimes do when talking about mysterious things such as &#8220;cleaning up the code base&#8221;. It&#8217;s the same difference, really.</div>

So presumably while you are waiting for the test suite to run, you are trying to throw out the blunt knife and the $30 DVD into a trash can that won&#8217;t open?  While squealing?  What a drag&#8230;</div>
