If I were to be marooned on a desert island and were allowed a single physical object to console me in my exile, that object would almost definitely be underpants. Should my captors show me mercy and treat clothes as a given, then I would probably ask for my Kindle. And a solar-powered USB charger, of course. Although why they would deign to let me take an item onto this rocky outcrop of doom is as much a mystery to me as why they would stick me there in the first place. But if it were three items, then it would definitely be my Kindle, a charger, and spare set of clean pants.<br /><br />Taking a Kindle renders the traditional dinner party question moot. The whole point – other than allowing everyone at the table a chance to briefly fantasize about escaping the present company – is to learn something of your companions. When someone chooses say, the Bible, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, and a Wodehouse omnibus, you learn that he (or she – but you can probably guess in this case who the hypothetical someone actually is), then you learn that he (or she) is a devout person with a passion for redemption narratives and tweed-core comedy. Or at least that this is what he wishes you to think of him.<br /><br />When our unlucky fellow diner picks a Kindle, you don&#8217;t get any of that. The best we can tell is that by picking an ebook reader over an iPod that he&#8217;s probably not a music person. Or it could be that he values personal hygiene over a set of headphones. You just can&#8217;t tell.<br /><br />More interesting to me is why we have all been sent to this desert island in the first place under such bizarre terms. How would we get there? <i>Lost</i>&nbsp;notwithstanding, modern communications technology rules out an accidental, Gilligan scenario. There must be some kind of intent. And let&#8217;s face it, whoever is abandoning us to the elements probably doesn&#8217;t exactly have our best interests at heart. Were they benevolent, there&#8217;d be much better ways of expressing it. They could give us an ice cream. Their intent, therefore, must be malicious.<br /><br />But why an island, rather than say, Wolverhampton? Why not just do us in? And why offer us comforts in a way that is both absurdly generous and yet so arbitrarily limited.<br /><br />One of the other guests has to be in on it. This is the only thing that makes sense. This guest employs agents who then strand us in different islands across the globe, making it look to each of us as if he (or she) were a hapless victim. An island, rather than a not particularly interesting city, much reduces the likelihood that we&#8217;ll ever be able to get back and inform on them – assuming any of us figures it out.<br /><br />And, presumably since we&#8217;re all at the same table together, we are all friends, or friends of friends, or (if we&#8217;re particularly unlucky) family. Thus it&#8217;s likely that this Judas in our midst shares kith or kin with us who he&#8217;d rather not bereave. Hence exile, not execution.<br /><br />No other explanation makes any sense.<br /><br />Next time someone asks you this question, be very suspicious. And don&#8217;t forget to ask about the pants. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

You are to be marooned on a Desert Island with a 1st generation iPod. You are given the chance to rip 11 CDs to .wav format. There are exits to the North and South. To the East is a hand operated moveable-type  press.<br /><br />&gt;&#8230;</div>

<br />I&#8217;ve been fascinated by English history since I first watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044760/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><i>Ivanhoe</i></a>&nbsp;as a young boy. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve got knights and barons and druids and archers and juries and parliaments and roses and Roundheads and Romans and Robin Hood. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve nefarious hunchbacks and mad kings and warrior queens. &nbsp;Who could ask for anything more?<br /><br />And, despite being <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fatal-Shore-Robert-Hughes/dp/0099448548/">Australian</a>, I think of British history as <i>my</i> history. Well, at least up until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet">1788</a>, and maybe even up until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federation">1901</a>. This partly comes from my mother &amp; her family being British emigrants and partly from consuming lots of British media, like the aforementioned Ivanhoe.<br /><br />Of course, technically I&#8217;m not British, I&#8217;m Irish. &nbsp;Mum was born in Dublin, and thus I&#8217;m an Irish citizen. &nbsp;When we were young she used to talk about her Irish granny and her thick Irish brogue and what not, but if ever our family talked about the Old Country (we didn&#8217;t) then really it&#8217;s Middlesex, England. I ended up with a vaguely English accent, which has only got worse (better) since moving to London.<br /><br />Certainly I didn&#8217;t know any of the stories of Ireland, at least not beyond St. Patrick. &nbsp;I could spin you a yarn about Captain Cook discovering the world, or Elizabeth I defeating the Spanish armada, or the noble, Christian Romano-Celts bravely failing to hold off an invasion from the smelly, pagan Germanic tribes, or the Jacobites toasting the King over the water, or Saxon peasants farming cows in order to serve the Norman lords their boeuf, but precious little about Ireland. &nbsp;So for a long time I was on the lookout for a book about Irish history, one that would give me an overview of the whole thing.<br /><br />The closest one I&#8217;ve found wasn&#8217;t <i>exactly</i> about Irish history, but was a fascinating book nonetheless. &nbsp;It&#8217;s <i>The Isles</i> by Norman Davies, and it aims to be a history of the British Isles spanning from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXzzHM8zLw">dawn of time</a>&nbsp;to the present day. There are three unusual things about it that are worth calling out.<br /><br />The first is that Davies is deliberately setting out to redress an imbalance in the way British history is taught. &nbsp;According to him, what is currently called British history is really <i>English</i>&nbsp;history. &nbsp;This seems true enough to me. &nbsp;The Magna Carta, Boadicea and Cromwell all have next to nothing to do with Scotland or Ireland [availability heuristic]. &nbsp;Hence the title, which<br />specifically avoids labelling the archipelago on which your correspondent&#8217;s posterior is now comfortably planted. It is the central conceit of the book: he tries to tell an Irish history together with an English history, a Scottish history and a Welsh history.<br /><br />He takes it further though, seizing every opportunity he can to point out this confusion at the heart of British identity. &nbsp;In his discussion of the Victorian era, he even goes to the lengths of referring to an English &#8220;inner empire&#8221; which forms the blueprint for the British &#8220;outer empire&#8221;. &nbsp;He points out that Shakespeare got his geography wrong when he called England &#8220;this scepter&#8217;d isle&#8221;, and that the thing that makes <i>Land of Hope and Glory</i> work is that the land in question is conveniently left unspecified.<br /><br />The second quirk is in Davies&#8217;s nomenclature. &nbsp;He insists on trying to spell the names of people and places the way they would have. &nbsp;Thus, William the Conquerer is always &#8220;Guillaume&#8221; because he was French, you know. &nbsp;It does not work at all in the pre-historic parts (the &#8220;Midnight Isles&#8221;? Really?), but works surprisingly well once history actually gets going. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t help but think of King James I of England differently when you are &nbsp;reminded every time his name is mentioned that he always signed himself &#8220;Jacques&#8221;.<br /><br />Third, he bangs on about Europe. Instead of keeping his island history properly insular, he is constantly referring to how political and economic forces on the mainland – I mean, the Continent – have driven events in Britain and Ireland. It&#8217;s almost as if he thinks that the Sleeve – sorry, the Channel – is small enough to swim across.<br /><br />It&#8217;s these three things that make <i>The Isles</i>&nbsp;what it is. &nbsp;Whether people praise it or condemn it, they generally do so for these three reasons. Otherwise, the book is entertaining and well written. &nbsp;Since I was reading it to cure myself of ignorance I am the worst possible judge of its accuracy. The best I can say there is that whatever fibs Davies tells are at least plausible. &nbsp;It is colossally heavy though, so if you can get an electronic copy, do so.<br /><br />If you don&#8217;t have the time, may I suggest <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/1066-All-That-W-C-Sellar/dp/0413772705/">1066 and All That</a>&nbsp;</i>instead?<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: island.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span><br /></div>

<i>Well, it sort of looks like Homer Simpson, only more dynamic and resourceful</i><br /><br />It seems a silly thing to write about, doesn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m not entirely sure why I picked it actually. Perhaps it&#8217;s because both Bice and I have gone through stages of growing our hair out, and I wanted to see how his experiences compared with mine.<br /><br />When I moved to London in &#8216;09 after a couple of mostly miserable years in Sydney, I wanted to do something to break with the past, and especially with the suffocating conformity that seemed, at least to me, to pervade the North Shore. Being a polite, risk-averse sort of lad, this was never going to take the form of piercings, eye make-up or tattoos. I wish I had the confidence to do something so bold. I struggle even something as tame as a t-shirt with an actual <i>colour</i>&nbsp;on it. I wasn&#8217;t (and still amn&#8217;t) persuaded of my ability to grow a convincing beard, and, well, let&#8217;s be honest with each other here, very few men&#8217;s looks are improved by a moustache. Since my imagination then was just as limited as it is now, that left me only with the rather passive option of keeping my wavy tresses away from anything sharp.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always been a little vain about my hair. Well, maybe more than a little. I can&#8217;t visit a barber or hairdresser without them commenting on how thick it is, and I&#8217;ve actually had at least one intentionally awful haircut, given by a vindictive barber sporting a comb-over. So as I was growing my hair out, I nursed a secret hope that I&#8217;d come to look like some dashing figure from olden times, perhaps like Tristan in Stardust. That didn&#8217;t work out. Most charitably, I looked like a plump Severus Snape.<br /><br />I grew it out for a year, maybe a little more, never reaching quite long enough to put into a pony tail. The main thing along the way that surprised me—apart from not looking like a Dothraki warrior—was the way it made me feel crappier when waking up. Maybe it&#8217;s just the weight of the stuff, or perhaps it got in my eyes while I slept. Whatever the cause but I&#8217;d wake up feeling even more slothful, resentful and lethargic than I normally do. This was dire.<br /><br />I can&#8217;t recall exactly what made me decide to have my <a href="http://static.mumak.net/back-before.jpg">dazzling locks</a> shorn from off my scalp. I think that I realized that, for me, what had started as a statement of my individuality had become a kind of flag of surrender, a sign that I couldn&#8217;t be bothered, that I&#8217;d given up on myself. Realizing this wasn&#8217;t easy, but eventually I cottoned on, and through what I understand to be the grace of God came to embrace life again. After that, getting a haircut seemed like the obvious thing to do, a sort of visible expression of my escape from the Slough of Despond<br /><br />That got way <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI">more serious</a> than I had&nbsp;<span id="goog_1850648565"></span>intended<span id="goog_1850648566"></span><span id="goog_1850648558"></span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

<br />On Friday, Joliette and I went to see a performance of <i>Macbeth</i>, directed by Jamie Lloyd with James McAvoy playing the doomed Scotsman mentioned in the title. It was a disappointing production, much like the only other staging of <i>Macbeth</i>&nbsp;I&#8217;ve seen, which was by the Bell Shakespeare Company in Australia.<br /><br />This is a real shame, since until someone hands me a cheque for several million pounds, <i>Macbeth</i> will probably remain my favourite thing written in English. I&#8217;m deeply concerned that I&#8217;ll never see a staging that I will actually enjoy.<br /><br />The problem is the witches and the war. &nbsp;The directors of the productions I&#8217;ve seen want it to be historical fiction that they can move into the present day, generally into some gritty, nebulously defined, modern warfare scenario. Thing is, once you complement your swords with a bit of sorcery, you&#8217;ve bought yourself a genre problem: fantasy.<br /><br />When men are walking around wearing fatigues and camouflage paint, carrying machine guns and machetes, having three weird sisters magically turn up and actually predict the future is always going to grate. &nbsp;Even if you shun the Call of Duty staging and go for a blasted heath and wither&#8217;d sedge approach, the fantasy element will remain problematic for at least three reasons.<br /><br />First, there&#8217;s the unaccountable distaste that many people seem to have for the genre itself. &nbsp;Ursula Le Guin observed that Americans seem to be afraid of dragons. &nbsp;No book kept on the fantasy shelf ever wins a Booker: if it does, it gets moved to live with the real literature. My mother is physically incapable of referring to the genre as anything other than &#8220;that fantasy crap&#8221;.<br /><br />If you dodge this, you could get the fantasy fanboy problem, where everything is cooler if you shove a dragon into it. (John Scalzi <a href="http://www.tor.com/stories/2011/04/the-shadow-war-of-the-night-dragons-book-one-the-dead-city-excerpt">skewers this beautifully</a>.) &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite likely that the reason that there are witches in the play at all is because of King James&#8217;s affinity for the subject. &nbsp;The &#8220;double, double, toil and trouble&#8221; bit added to the play &nbsp;by Davenant was inserted as a crowd pleaser. To say it distracts from the story is to understate the case: it&#8217;s almost as pointless as adding an extended tap dance scene in the middle of <i>Die Hard</i>.<br /><br />Finally, blessed few people actually believe in the supernatural at all. Even if you aren&#8217;t prejudiced against the fantastic, to be convinced by the psychological realism of the play, you have to buy in to the reality of the witches. This isn&#8217;t helped by the sheer difficulty of making magic look magical on the stage. Even Tolkien found the witches <a href="http://bjorn.kiev.ua/librae/Tolkien/Tolkien_On_Fairy_Stories.htm">difficult to credit</a>.<br /><br />You can&#8217;t get rid of them either. You can, if you wish, interpret the dagger and Banquo&#8217;s ghost as the death throes of his tortured conscience, as mere figments of his imagination. But in the scene where Macbeth first meets the witches, Banquo is there too. Banquo sees and hears them, and takes the lead in interrogating them. Nothing in the play would make sense if they are not real.<br /><br />But I wouldn&#8217;t want to. There is much fascinating ground to be explored in the nexus between the supernatural and the psychological. Much good urban fantasy (<i>Neverwhere</i>&nbsp;by Neil Gaiman, <i>Wizard of the Pigeons</i> by Megan Lindholm) and even some epic fantasy (notably the <i>Thomas Covenant</i> books by Stephen R. Donaldson) does this. I am rather happy that the Bard seemed to think so too, but wish he had the foresight to write a novel.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: hair.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span><br /></div>

I&#8217;m sitting in <a href="http://www.gladstoneslibrary.org/">Gladstone&#8217;s Library</a>, a residential library established by the former British prime minister in Hawarden, Wales.

No better way to prejudice me against a film than to have it star Keira Knightley and Jude Law. Hmm, maybe &quot;directed by M. Night Shyamalan&quot; is worse. Anyway, I haven&#39;t seen it, and am not rushing to see it.<br /><br />I guess &#39;too didactic&#39; is a good way of putting it. The amazing thing throughout the book is its psychological realism and Tolstoy&#39;s uncanny empathy for his characters. Two people could be having an awkward conversation, and he somehow conveys both their points of view as well as both sides of what each imagines the other to be thinking. During the final chapter, he abandons all of that, leaving a very likable character to expound Tolstoy&#39;s views on Christianity. It seemed very forced, and reminded me of much that I disliked about <i>War and Peace</i><br /><br />GTD re-read lead to me reinvigorating my collection habit and putting a greater emphasis on making decisions about actions up-front (esp. w/ email). Which was great, until my system got annihilated by starting to work from an office with very strict data security requirements. </div>

Keen to hear what you thought of the recent film: I thought it was a real winner, despite not being a strong drama (!)<br /><br />I haven&#39;t read the book (yet). What didn&#39;t you like about the ending? Too didactic?<br /><br />Also keen to hear what came of your GTD re-read!</div>

I&#39;m reading Anna Karenina right now. Finding it slow going, partly because I&#39;m reading it in a very piecemeal fashion in the tiny pockets of time I have to myself these days, and partly because I chose to read it on our Kindle (I have a complicated relationship with ebooks). The farming stuff is GREAT! And the description of the landscape changing from winter to spring in Part Two is delightful. </div>

I am not watching a game of football now, but instead watching men and boys, sometimes women, shuffle toward a stadium in brightly coloured scarves. The weather is cold, bitterly and unseasonably so, but they would wear them anyway.<br /><br />I live near Stamford Bridge, so their scarves are blue and white and rather new, and their clothes are a kind of stylish yet rugged outdoor-wear worn by urban professionals everywhere. During the season they are here almost every week, filling the streets and the train stations and kebab shops. It&#8217;s hard for me not to think ill of them. The mere physical fact of thousands of strangers occupying space in my neighbourhood is enough to set me on edge, as if somehow this is my place, and that I understand it and love it in a way they do not and they are only using it to get to their stupid football match.<br /><br />Which is, of course, a foolish way to think.<br /><br />Just as foolish as my old snobbery to football. When I was growing up in Queensland, everyone followed &#8220;the footy&#8221;, by which they meant Rugby League. The Brisbane Broncos were winning almost every game they played and held the Winfield Cup, as it was then called. I affected not to like it, simply because I wanted to be different, or perhaps to show everyone how different I was. Sources differ.<br /><br />As I grew up a little more, somehow it became less important to show that I was different and more important to show that I was one of us. So I started to watch bits of games on the telly with Dad and James, slowly learning about tries and conversions and dummy-halfs and being off-side. The game grew on me, slowly but surely.<br /><br />At its worst, League is a dull, grinding game. One man runs for five metres before hitting a wall of solid meat. Everyone stops. Repeat this four more times. Then kick the ball as far down the field as you can. &nbsp;The other side picks up the ball and does the same thing in the opposite direction. Repeat.<br /><br />At its best – the kind of football you see played at Origin – this same stodginess and linearity provides the structure for some amazingly creative and exciting play. You have to be tricky if you are going to get past the opposition.<br /><br />And once you do … there&#8217;s hardly anything as exciting or gripping as watching Alfie Langer wearing maroon and speeding down the wing of the field, untouchable, to score a try for Queensland.<br /><br />Even so, I never became a passionate fan. I&#8217;d always watch Origin and watch the occasional Broncos game, but the sports pages just bored me, and I didn&#8217;t see any point in watching two New South Wales teams play each other.<br /><br />When we moved to Tasmania, we stopped watching League. Down there, &#8220;footy&#8221; means Australian Rules, and the game I grew up watching is mocked as &#8220;thugby&#8221;. Tasmanians care deeply about the footy and most that I know are passionate supporters of their teams. I tried to get into the game, and to an extent I succeeded – I won&#8217;t go out of my way to watch a game, but if I&#8217;m given the choice between that and Masterchef I&#8217;m watching the footy – but I&#8217;m never going to care as much about the Brisbane Lions as I did about the Brisbane Broncos.<br /><br />Now I&#8217;m here in the UK, and football is different yet again. Aussie geeks are supposed to like soccer, I think, and I even played a little when I was nine or ten, but I can&#8217;t seem to actually watch a game all the way through. I can&#8217;t find a way in, so it just sits there perfectly spherical, somehow managing to be at this same time both polished and dull.<br /><br />I&#8217;m missing out, I know that. I don&#8217;t get to join in on those crisp Sunday afternoons when well-heeled, rosy-cheeked, and eager families tramp into Stamford Bridge. Even the shared misery after a 4-0 &nbsp;thumping has something communal, some sense of belonging, that I&#8217;m outside.<br /><br />Happily, London is less of a monoculture than Tasmania or outback Queensland: to be apathetic about football here doesn&#8217;t make a statement in the same way that it does back home. And although I still do stupidly, pathetically care about what people think of me, I hope I&#8217;m letting that master me less.<br /><br />If I could just convince the Chelsea fans to stand on the right at Earls Court, then everything would be rosy.<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: guard.<br /><div><br /></div><div><small>This post is part of the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> project, a collaboration between myself and <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.</small></div></div>

<br />A long while ago I complained a bit on this blog about how difficult it was to find good fantasy books to read. It&#8217;s still a problem for me: I still like fantasy, and I still struggle to find examples of the form that I actually enjoy.<br /><br />Take <i>Wise Man&#8217;s Fear</i>&nbsp;by Patrick Rothfuss as an example. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a hugely successful novel that has been praised by authors and critics and that I hate, and so it makes a good lens through which to look at the rest of the genre.<br /><br />It opens with a prologue that aims way too high, trying to be poetic and evocative but ending up sounding merely pretentious. The silence of the protagonist is described as being &#8220;the patient, cut-flower sound of a man waiting to die&#8221;.<br /><br />My guess is that most prose writers regularly write passages like this where their ambition exceeds their ability and what they hoped would be beautiful or masterly ends up being unreadably florid – I&#8217;ve certainly inflicted more than my share of such on readers of this blog. But it seems that fantasy is rife with purple prose like this, and I think more so than other genres.<br /><br />It might just be that fantasy imprints have sloppier editors than other genres, but I think it&#8217;s actually because of something good about fantasy. Done right, fantasy fiction can make you feel like you&#8217;re touching something transcendent and fill you with a sense of wonder in a way that no other form of fiction seems to. It&#8217;s that feeling that keeps me coming back to the genre. But it is a tricky thing to do well, and the failure mode is writing that makes you think more about the description than the thing that it&#8217;s describing.<br /><br />Once <i>Wise Man&#8217;s Fear</i> gets going, we learn about Kvothe, who is absolutely amazing at everything that he does. In the previous book, we are shown how he is amazingly intelligent, a prodigy at magic, and perhaps the greatest musician this (made up!) world has ever known. In this book, we are subjected to him explaining how awesome he is at martial arts, court diplomacy, and sex.<br /><br />This seems to be a thing that sells books. It happens in genres outside fantasy too: Lee Child seems to spend a large chunk of his mental energy getting off on how bad-ass Jack Reacher is. I&#8217;ve got no idea how anyone can actually enjoy being told how great the author&#8217;s made up person is at all the things. To me, it&#8217;s like those conversations you have when you are six years old, insisting that you double dare them infinity plus one times. I get that heroes need to actually be heroic, and that following along with them doing great things is part of the fun, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be adolescent wish fulfilment.<br /><br />When I started my quest to find more decent fantasy back in 2009, I wanted to find books that actual felt magical, the way that <i>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</i>, or <i>Sandman</i>, or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>&nbsp;did. Now I&#8217;ll settle for finding fantasy that&#8217;s well edited, isn&#8217;t self-congratulatory tosh, and has enough of a plot to keep me turning the pages.<br /><br />Recommendations welcome.<br /><br /><br /><small>This post is part of the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a> series that I&#8217;m doing with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a></small>.</div>

I&#39;ve read <i>Tigana</i> and quite enjoyed it. I agree that it&#39;s one of his best. I also read his magicked-up historical fiction from time to time, and although I haven&#39;t come across anything that&#39;s quite as good as <i>Tigana</i>, it&#39;s a pleasant enough way to pass the time.<br /><br />I tried <i>The Way of Kings</i> again. I pushed through the prelude, with its eternally dying characters and made up monsters and magic swords (no, wait, &quot;Blades&quot;) and got to the first page of book one, at which point I got hit with so many made up words I had to stop.<br /><br />It&#39;s fantasy, so of course there are going to be made up monsters and Words capitalized for the sake of it.  But, at least for me, I have to trust the author to go along with it.  And, for Sanderson in the <i>The Way of Kings</i>, I don&#39;t.  He doesn&#39;t even seem to try to earn my trust or to convince me there&#39;s a story worth telling.<br /><br />I can imagine reading the same text and being intrigued instead of annoyed, and maybe some day when I&#39;m in a different mood, I will. At this stage, it would be for the sake of the warm recommendation rather than anything alluring in Sanderson&#39;s prose.</div>

Have you already tried Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay? A weakness of Kay&#39;s writing is that it is rather heavy on moralising and a bit stuffy. However, his best writing, and I think Tigana is amongst his best, is also thoughtful, with engaging characters. Tigana is particularly good because it deals with such difficult themes. One side of the book is the efforts of a plucky and noble bunch of rebels to oust the evil invader to their land&#8230; but the other side of the book is from that invader, who is a deeply sympathetic character. It&#39;s a fantasy story where you grow to love both sets of characters even as they are locked in conflict.<br /><br />Secondly, I know that you already read the first few pages of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s The Way of Kings and turned away from it in disappointment. I would encourage you give it another go. It is of the breed of &quot;epic&quot; fantasy that takes some time to get going, but I think it is well worth it. Something that is true across of Sanderson&#39;s books is that you sometimes find yourself wincing at the flawed view of a character. However, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s what the book, or the author, espouses. His books take characters with a great many different viewpoints and let them really develop over the story. If you haven&#39;t the time for The Way of Kings then Mistborn is also very good.</div>

It&#39;s interesting that you would mention Lord of the Rings. I believe Lord of the Rings (or possibly The Hobbit; I read them together and I can&#39;t recall in what order) was the first fantasy literature I ever read (at the age of 7 or so), and I found it utterly amazing. In retrospect, while Tolkien&#39;s world-building was impressive, the actual writing in Lord of the Rings was extremely tiresome to wade through, and it&#39;s not something I usually recommend to other people as an enjoyable read.</div>

I&#8217;m not entirely sure exactly where I&#8217;ve announced it already, but in February I finished up my employment with Canonical.<div><br /></div><div>I started there in January 2007, which means I&#8217;d been with the company over six years. I don&#8217;t know exactly how to categorize these things, but the only other organization that I was involved with for anywhere near as long was primary school, and that just doesn&#8217;t seem to be directly comparable.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had a blast at Canonical, made many good friends, and learned a great deal. I saw much of the world, met crazy, intelligent, interesting, eccentric people, learned how to play Cambridge Standard Five Card Mao, started a few useful side projects and perhaps even made a small contribution to the wider world. I kept being thrown into situations where I&#8217;d have to work with people who were heaps better than me at what they did, and then they&#8217;d graciously and kindly help me get better.</div><div><br /></div><div>And so, making my exit was a bit hard. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know how to do it right, because it&#8217;s been a very long time since I&#8217;ve left a job.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The bit that I didn&#8217;t expect to be hard was pronouns. They are actually still giving me trouble.</div><div><br /></div><div>You see, when I was working at Canonical, <i>we</i>&nbsp;made Launchpad and <i>we </i>were trying to cross the chasm, and <i>we </i>needed to get [whatever] done by [whenever] if we were going to succeed. It&#8217;s all very straight-forward first person plural. There&#8217;s lots of us, and I am one of us, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be</div><div><br /></div><div>Once the notice was handed in, though, I had to start talking about <i>you</i>, at least in the future. That&#8217;s really awkward. Although I&#8217;m still formally one of us, the knowledge that I&#8217;ll soon be one of them breaks <i>we</i>&nbsp;into you<i> </i>and I. To be honest, it just sounded rude.</div><div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Thing is, there&#8217;s something in the oft-made point that you can&#8217;t leave one place without entering another. Every exit is also an entrance. So now I&#8217;m working at <a href="https://www.google.com/">my new job</a>, I&#8217;m facing the same problem in reverse. Occasionally I talk about things that I helped do at Canonical, or even decisions I helped to make, and it&#8217;s very hard not to say <i>we</i>, because in the past it was us who did it. &nbsp;Likewise, when encountering differences there, it&#8217;s hard not say &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s how you do things here&#8221; or &#8220;Man, you&#8217;ve got some cool technology&#8221;. So I&#8217;m not quite one of them yet, at least grammatically. I&#8217;m getting there though.</div><div><br /></div><div>The people I&#8217;m working with are fun and very good at what they do. Even apart from the job itself, I&#8217;m learning things from most of them every day. Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be making another exit and leaving the UK to go work with them and some of our US colleagues in Chicago. Despite not looking forward to being away from Jolie for a week, I am looking forward to that. Perhaps I&#8217;ll teach them Cambridge Standard Five-Card Mao.</div><div><br /></div><div>Next week&#8217;s word: fantasy.</div><div><br /></div></div>

<br />I do a ridiculous amount of exercise. I don&#8217;t say that to brag (well, maybe a little), but like a lot of people, my standards lag quite a lot behind my behaviour, and by the standards I had five years ago, I do a ridiculous amount of exercise.<br /><br />Back then, I did absolutely no exercise at all, and certainly nothing resembling sport. I had a couple of stints of going to the gym, but they never lasted very long and never amounted to anything. From my childhood right up until I started kickboxing, I could never find a form of exercise that I actually enjoyed.<br /><br />These days, I spend six hours in the dojo every week, and all of that time is spentshuffling around, punching and kicking, with a couple of breaks for stretching.<br /><br />Quite frankly, it&#8217;s exhausting. I get there before six and by the time I get home again it&#8217;s after ten and I struggle to find the energy to shower and go to bed.<br /><br />Even so, it&#8217;s a lot of fun, and I&#8217;ve learnt so much. I want to share some of these with you.<br /><br /><b>Hard work</b><br /><br />Perhaps the biggest thing is the power of hard work applied over time. Each session in the dojo <i>is</i> hard work, and there are plenty of times when there&#8217;s a technique that I can&#8217;t figure out, or a fighter who I can&#8217;t seem to touch, or I&#8217;m frustrated by how slow I am or how low my kicks are. &nbsp;But over the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve learned that I can overcome all of these things simply by <i>trying</i> over and over.<br /><br />This might sound a trite lesson, but it was pretty profound for me. Until I started kickboxing, most things I tried either came easily to me or were things that I gave up quickly (see gym above). Kickboxing was the first thing that was difficult from the get go that I&#8217;ve stuck with. As such, it&#8217;s become my own personal illustration of the value of hard work.<br /><br /><b>The mental thing</b><br /><br />Secondly, I&#8217;ve learnt that ability in exercise is, to a surprising degree, psychological. I used to hear football players and Olympians on the telly talk about how it was all a mental game and how they needed to focus and get their head right and I used to think that they actually had no idea what they are talking about. Chess is a mental game, programming requires focus, but swimming laps is not &#8220;all in the mind&#8221;. If it were, why would they need such big shoulders?<br /><br />Now I&#8217;m sorry for being so arrogant. I&#8217;ve been physically exhausted, being tired, hungry and thirsty with flat feet and leaden limbs and nothing left to give at the end of hours of non-stop exercise, but then, as our instructor started to cheer us on for the final ten calls, felt energy come back and start to punch fast and kick high again. Where does that come from?<br /><br /><b>Metaphors</b><br /><br />As the last couple of sections illustrate, many of the cliches that are repeated constantly by folk who exercise now have actual content for me. That&#8217;s pretty cool, because it means that there are great sections of people&#8217;s lives that I&#8217;m able to connect with in a way that I couldn&#8217;t before.<br /><br />I hope also that it&#8217;s humbling. &nbsp;In the past, I was a bit dismissive of sport and the like, discounting it as something not worth bothering with. Now, at least in the form of kickboxing, it&#8217;s an important part of my life. How many other rich, interesting, rewarding things are going on in the lives of others that I&#8217;m ignoring, that I can&#8217;t even begin to connect to?<br /><br /><b>Food</b><br /><br />You can&#8217;t outrun your fork. Well, maybe you can, but I certainly can&#8217;t. I can exercise a lot and be quite fit cardiovascularly, but still put on weight by eating too much crappy food.<br /><br /><b>Body</b><br /><br />For the first time in my life, after years of being a klutz and feeling overweight, I feel some degree of mastery over my own body. I&#8217;ve got so much to learn, and so much to correct, but there are times when I actually feel skillful, and have the same pleasure in the working of my body that I do when I&#8217;m programming and &#8220;in the zone&#8221;.<br /><br /><br />For any other late-comers to exercise out there, does this chime with your experience? &nbsp;Have you learned different things?<br /><br />For life-long jocks, what have you struggled to communicate to lazy slobs like me?<br /><br /></div>

I feel happy for you, Jon - very few people manage to break in to a physical discipline at this stage in life.<br />As not so much a &quot;jock&quot;, but a general outdoors-type/adrenalin junkie, and somebody who started regular martial arts practice as a pale young boy aged 12, it&#39;s interesting to hear the question of what I&#39;ve been unable to communicate successfully to those who don&#39;t have physical discipline.<br /><br />Actually, I think you the hit the nail on the head in your comments on &quot;Hard Work&quot;. The notion there is that despite not getting the instant positive feedback, the gratification of receiving pay-off from even a minimal input of effort, you _persist_ with the practice, suspending the requirement to see the results immediately. You follow a path laid out by your instructor, having faith(!) that the results you want to see will eventually come about. And of course, the results that come are typically greater than you anticipated &#8230;.<br /><br />This is part of the principle Shu-Ha-Ri (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) which we learn in Shorinji Kempo - and you very eloquently stated why it is so difficult to convey to those unfamiliar with physical practice (especially martial and related arts). The reason is that the intellectual concept is, as you say, trite and uninteresting. The value is only evident in experience - which means you can argue the point till you&#39;re blue in the face with a &quot;slob&quot;, but they won&#39;t be engaged until they have felt the value of the practice itself.<br /><br />I have had the &quot;breaking-in&quot; experience myself again in recent years with my learning to surf, which has been a very slow learning curve - perhaps the slowest pay-off activity I&#39;ve ever practiced! But ultimately very worthwhile.<br />I think this is probably one reason your comments are echoing fresh in my mind!<br /><br />Great stuff - keep it coming.</div>

Hard work you mention there reminds me of distinction between &quot;fixed mindset&quot; and &quot;growth mindset&quot; from Mindset by Carol Dweck. That book changed the way I look at life. I always was the way you described, at least before doing my first marathon.<br /><br />As for the sports being a mental game, it holds true in every one of those which I tried, being it rock climbing, powerlifting, or ultrarunning. At some point you have to decide to continue despite the tiredness or pain. Here&#39;s a great video about that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrlmLvPFdg8 (@4:45 &quot;When you think you are done, you only 40%  into what your body is capable of doing, and that&#39;s just a limit that we put on ourselves&quot;).</div>

yep, can definitely empathise! I&#39;ve just started CrossFit a few weeks ago after decades of inactivity. I too have pretty much always shunned exercise or tried and given up. And, like you, have finally picked something that&#39;s bloody hard! I dont know psychologically why this is the case, but it definitely fits with the &#39;all or nothing&#39; personality.</div>
