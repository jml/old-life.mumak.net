Ever wanted to start a business in Australia? The World Bank is here to tell you <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/ExploreEconomies/?economyid=12">exactly what to expect</a>.<br /><br />Found out about this report in The Economist, looking forward to having a flick through.</div>

The first thing I see when I step off the shuttle bus is a broad, grey, washed-out expanse of floor. The airline staff sit enthroned on their check-in desks, reigning over their empty queues. In the far distance is a wireless hotspot, an ATM and a display cabinet full of prohibited articles.<br /><br />If I cross the expanse to the hotspot, I see fake moa footprints on the floor, leading to some exhibit upstairs. Sitting at the hotspot I can see a to-scale model of the airport in a plexiglass cabinet, rows of maroon chairs facing a wall, automatic massage chairs, the baggage carousel and the escalators. The escalators are always on, but the carousel moves only when a flight arrives.<br /><br />Strangely, the airport is as full of floating dandelion seeds as the city is. They tumble in the air conditioned breeze over the litter that tumbles on the ground. I don&#8217;t know why there are so many dandelions. When I was a child I&#8217;d use to catch them and whisper a wish into them and blow them away. Today I can&#8217;t remember what I wished for, so maybe it came true.<br /><br />Up the escalators, there&#8217;s a small display of the ancient flightless birds that walked the airport grounds long before the first plane arrived. It&#8217;s not very interesting. There&#8217;s a bank, and a news agent that sells only the shiniest of books and a souvenier store. I&#8217;d buy a souvenier, but I have enough black clothes already.<br /><br />The cafes seem built to remind you that you actually do have better places to be. I try sitting there for a bit, but rank boredom and bland hungerlessness drive me to move away. I wander around, trying to find something interesting. There&#8217;s a Koru Club upstairs that I&#8217;ll be refused entry to and a conference centre that will be simply locked. The bookstore still doesn&#8217;t have any Penguin Classics, so I can&#8217;t get the Bronte book I want. I go to the bathroom where I read about launching subprocesses in Haskell and reject two calls to my mobile phone.<br /><br />This last week, I&#8217;ve received several calls from private numbers. Each time the caller has sent me the sound of a phone being hung up as voice mail. The only people I know with private numbers are family members who are afraid of something I don&#8217;t understand. It could be any of them, or it could be a simple glitch in the global roaming phone system. I don&#8217;t care either way, but I wish they&#8217;d stop or leave a message.<br /><br />I&#8217;m tired, and I want to sleep. Soon I&#8217;ll buy something with chocolate in it and something else with words in it and sit with a runny nose being comforted by the chocolate and by someone else&#8217;s imaginary world. First though, I&#8217;ll do one more tour around the airport.</div>

You&#8217;re actually a really good writer, Jonno. Maybe pack in the whole programming thing and concentrate more on sentence crafting :)<BR/>(it&#8217;s what you do anyway, right, just not usually in English).<BR/><BR/>Nice post :)</div>

Great post JML. That took me straight there. I reckon airport bookshops are quite depressing. Racks full of sports magazines and paperbacks of Jodi Picoults and Tom Clancys (at best).</div>

And you should too!<br /><br />David Plotz read the Bible and then <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2212616">blogged about it on Slate</a>.<br /><blockquote>After spending a year with the good book, I’ve become a full-on Bible thumper. Everyone should read it—all of it! In fact, the less you believe, the more you should read. Let me explain why, in part by telling how reading the whole Bible has changed me.</blockquote>I&#8217;d love to see more honest, informed engagement with the Bible, particularly in Australia.<br /><br />Thanks <a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/crikey/2009/03/03/stuff-we-like-sitting-down-with-the-good-book/">Crikey</a>.</div>

I finished <span style="font-style: italic;">Love in the Time of Cholera</span> last night. I love the old age and the circular story-telling and the way it didn&#8217;t end tragically, even though I was expecting it to. And, of course, Marquez&#8217;s writing is beautiful, even through the dim glass of translation.</div>

I just did my first proper, authentic, recommended &#8220;Weekly Review&#8221;. It&#8217;s got three steps:<br /><ol><li>Get current</li><li>Get clear</li><li>Get creative</li></ol>For &#8220;get current&#8221;, the idea is that I empty my inbox, clear my desktop and sweep through my head for ideas or nagging worries on the tip of my tongue. So, that way, everything in my system is up to date with reality.<br /><br />&#8220;Get clear&#8221; means I go through my lists and check off everything that&#8217;s been done, add things that need to be done. For the purposes of this step, &#8220;lists&#8221; includes my calendar. The longest part of this step for me is going through my list of seventy or so &#8220;outcomes&#8221; and making sure that each of them has a next action.<br /><br />The final step is &#8220;get creative&#8221;. To be honest, by the time I&#8217;m done with the first two, it is almost 6pm on a Friday afternoon and this is a mentally impossibility.<br /><br />Maybe I should shift the whole process to a Monday morning. I&#8217;ll write a note to give that a try in April.</div>

Whoa, sounds thorough! <BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m not quite sure what &#8220;get creative&#8221; entails, but if you&#8217;ve been sitting at your desk reviewing all afternoon (or morning) could you then just shift venue? Eg, go out for dinner or something and do the creative stuff? Or go for a walk?(with notebook of course). Perhaps doing something enjoyable with that &#8216;blank slate&#8217; feeling might be helpful to creativity&#8230; just a few thoughts anyway.</div>
