One thing I didn&#8217;t mention in my first Berlin post was how terrifying I found the whole thing. It sounds silly now, but I was feeling more afraid than I have in quite some time â€” probably since my last job interview.<br /><br />When I left the hotel in London, I knew theoretically how to get to the Luton airport (Luton!) and from there to the Berlin and from there to the Ostbahnhof and from there to the hostel. But theory isn&#8217;t practice, and as Morpheus so wisely puts it, there&#8217;s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.<br /><br />So I spent the entire trip wondering what the hell I was doing and whether there would be a bed for me at the end of it all. There were momentary distractions while the plane was being shaken like an experimental cocktail, but overall doubt prevailed.<br /><br />Things got a lot worse when I left the Ostbahnhof (is this the right one?) and started walking up the Strasse der Pariser Kommune (is this the right way?). I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever walked in the dark before along a road you don&#8217;t know to a place you&#8217;ve never been. Whenever I&#8217;ve done it, time and distance seem to dilate: It can&#8217;t be <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> far away, surely? Maybe I&#8217;ve passed it already? What if the address on the website is wrong? Maybe places are numbered differently in Berlin? Were the photos on the hostel website a total lie?<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve ever been on a walk like this, you&#8217;ll know the joy of seeing clear street numbers in the right order, of first seeing your destination and finally arriving there. The hostel turns out to be as nice as the pictures, and the staff were so friendly it completely caught me off guard. I went to bed with clean linen, a fresh towel and a mind perfectly ready for sleep.</div>

Ach, reminds me of everytime I get into a new Indian town in the middle of the night, with no hostel booked, and everything closed.</div>

Today I wandered around town on my own. I walked up Karl-Marx Allee until I reached Alexander Platz in Mitte. Once there, I climbed the tallest tower in the city and surveyed the realm that will soon be mine. There&#8217;s way too much fog here.<br /><br />I turned my gaze to the East and saw the buildings wrought by Stalin and the factories and the river. I saw the people&#8217;s park and ruins of an abbey and a clock that shows all the times of the world. My gaze turned West and the Tiergarten and the Dom and the Reichstag were among the things I beheld.<br /><br />I descended to the streets of the city and saw people cycling and shops slowly opening. Eventually one shop offered me a European power adapter, which I accepted with gratitude and humility. Thus exhausted, I returned home on the U-Bahn, where I spoke partly in German and partly in English with an eighty-year old woman who studied theology years ago.<br /><br />Today, I&#8217;m tired and do not want to do anything. Let&#8217;s see what happens.</div>

Decisions are funny things. Yesterday, if I had to decide whether to stay a week in a hostel in a foreign city I would have said &#8220;No, I want to go home&#8221;, but I&#8217;m here thanks to a decision I made months ago.  We&#8217;ll see how that one works out.<br /><br />Right now, I&#8217;m going to explore the city, perhaps even on an organized tour.</div>

Awesome, I&#8217;d love to go to Berlin. Some people think organised tours are tacky and limited. They are, I suppose, but I think you&#8217;ve got to embrace them. They can be an experience in themselves.<BR/><BR/>Hope you&#8217;re going well over there.</div>

Finally, the Launchpad Epic is over. It&#8217;s been two weeks of very intense activity, with training, workshops, arguments, presentations, lightning talks and pirate costumes.<br /><br />The training was dull but everything else was really good. I did a couple of lightning talks and one full-length presentation, and people seemed to like all them.<br /><br />I&#8217;m continually amazed at what a cool company I work for. There are so many smart, competent, interesting people in the same room, actually getting things done.<br /><br />Now I need to figure out how to get to my hostel in Berlin&#8230;</div>

It&#8217;s the end of a long, weird and dreary Saturday in London. I&#8217;m sitting in the hotel bar, trying hard not to work on my slides. I don&#8217;t know if I can explain exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> today felt so strange. I think perhaps everything takes on a quirky double life when you are tired under a sky that&#8217;s boiling apocalyptic grey.<br /><br />So far, the trip&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s energizing being with the rest of <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad">the Launchpad team</a> again. It&#8217;s the first time this year that we&#8217;ve all been awake at the same time, let alone in the same room. If you&#8217;ve never been to a sprint, it&#8217;s hard to explain. The buzz is not just from meeting old friends, it&#8217;s also from the feeling that now we can <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> get down to business.<br /><br />In any case, things have been so busy that I haven&#8217;t had any time to stop and think, and it&#8217;s the sort of busy that&#8217;s not always interesting to report. Right now, I&#8217;m going to go back to working on my slides and recuperating: the next week looms.</div>

Things have been rather busy around here for me. I&#8217;m heading off to London for a two-week epic hacking adventure with the rest of my colleagues, and the preparation has taken up all of my free time.<br /><br />Well, not quite <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>. I&#8217;ve also just purchased a <a href="http://www-604.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?storeId=10000036&amp;catalogId=-36&amp;langId=036&amp;categoryId=4611686018425096207&amp;seriesid=2060574">new laptop</a> and have been spending a fair bit of time getting it ready to use as a development machine. I&#8217;m quite enamoured of its light weight and rugged keyboard.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also been reading a fair bit:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Economics</span>, The Economist Group</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">Master and Commander<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span></span></span>Patrick O&#8217;Brian</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Fionovar Tapestry</span> (again), Guy Gavriel Kay</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Book of Commonsense Investing</span>, John Bogle<br /></li></ul>And the occasional Gerard Manley Hopkins poem. What I really want is another vast book to lose myself in, like <span style="font-style: italic;">House of Leaves</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Jonathan Strange</span> â€” I guess they don&#8217;t grow on trees though.</div>

Thanks for the recommendations Benny.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve given up on Neal Stephenson. <I>Cryptonomicon</I> was great, but the follow-up, <I>Quicksilver</I> was pretty terrible from start to finish.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ll have a look at USA though.</div>

<a href="http://puzzling.org/identity/">Mary</a> recently posted about the Government&#8217;s <a href="http://puzzling.org/logs/thoughts/2008/October/14/internet-filtering">Internet filtering proposal</a>, exhorting readers to write a letter to the Minister and Shadow Minister responsible for this area.<br /><br />I always mean well with these things, but never get around to doing anything. Since it&#8217;s entirely possible that others share my predicament, I&#8217;ve decided to post this guide to writing to an MP.<br /><ol><li>Locate an envelope and a stamp. Do it now.</li><li>Find the address of the MP on the governments website and write it on the envelope. Although you may be tempted to stamp the envelope, you should restrain yourself.</li><li>Open up a word processor, a real word processor. Do not use LaTeX, LyX, reST, HTML, SGML, Docbook, Lore, MediaWiki, Emacs, Gobby, TextMate, Vim, WordPress, Twitter or Facebook. It is impossible to write a letter using any of these things. I recommend OpenOffice Word Processor.</li><li>Type your full name and postal address. Do not format it.</li><li>Type the MP&#8217;s full title, name and address.</li><li>Address the MP formally, e.g. &#8220;Senator Conroy,&#8221;.</li><li>Write the letter. Say what you want in the first paragraph, and support that want in the following paragraphs, conclude with a call to action. Keep it short, keep it clear, be respectful, be definite.<br /></li><li>Conclude with a call to action. It&#8217;s important that you do this.</li><li>&#8220;Yours sincerely, [[your real name]]&#8221;</li><li>Format the letter. Be conservative.<br /></li><li>Print the letter.</li><li>Read over it. Read it out loud.<br /></li><li>Make the changes you must make. Remove a little more than you can bear to remove.</li><li>Print the letter.</li><li>Sign it.</li><li>Fold it neatly.</li><li>Insert it into the envelope. Do not seal the envelope.<br /></li><li>Double check the address.</li><li>Seal the envelope.</li><li>Stamp the envelope.</li><li>Walk to the nearest post box â€” there is one close to you â€” and post the letter. Do it now.</li></ol>If you want to send a letter, you must follow these instructions: there is simply no other way to do it.</div>

I liked it too. I&#8217;ve been having concerns about our education systems for a while and this contributed a few more pages in a mental book of critique.</div>

A fantastic talk that raises so many things for me. Let me offload (I actually wrote &#8220;overload&#8221; first!?):<BR/><BR/>- In countries where creativity *is* valued (eg dance in Latin America) the education system is dry and involves rote learning only (not that this isn&#8217;t a form of intelligence). So a culture that values creativity in general doesn&#8217;t necessary value it in education. <BR/><BR/>- I feel really strongly about this sort of thing. I think of very talented people who don&#8217;t realise they&#8217;re talented and who might even think they&#8217;re dumb or a failure. Everyone - including people with disabilities - has something to offer and something that will bring them pleasure. <BR/><BR/>- What has helped me realise my talents and creativity is: being told of my talents; being given free reign (to do things my way or to decide what I will do full stop); being encouraged; being understood and supported through the glitches; being given wise suggestions/guidance. This was done (as you know) in the context of a church apprenticeship. <BR/><BR/>- I think the Christian idea of different people having different gifts, each person occupying a different, valuable part in the body has a lot to offer. <BR/><BR/>- Maybe the trickest thing educationally is that the teacher won&#8217;t share all the students&#8217; gifts and it&#8217;s difficult to teach people stuff *you* don&#8217;t Know. But maybe that&#8217;s where the model I experienced in my apprenticeship comes in. <BR/>How does all this fit with what you (used to?) think about how schools should just be to teach reading and writing and other things are for the other things? <BR/><BR/>Fi</div>
