This sounds like a bunch of prompts for fiction. Write the entry you imagine Jonathan writing about the kissing French couple&#8230;</div>

I don&#8217;t find it a problem - I think of it as an exhaustive meditation on a cultural phenomenon rather than an argument, so if feels like my perspective is deepening&#8230;</div>

Yeah, I have to thank you for turning me on to Rankin, Benny. And Wind-up Bird Chroncile, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.<BR/><BR/>Sontag is brilliant &#8211; no doubt. My problem with <I>On Photography</I> is that she at no point makes a coherent argument. It&#8217;s like reading a very, very smart creative person writing something that has the cadence of an argument, but is actually a bunch of near-related assertions. <BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s doubly frustrating, because it makes it hard to tell what&#8217;s profound insight and what&#8217;s pretentious word play.</div>

I really like Ian Rankin, he is my crime/light reading sanctuary in a busy world of literature. <BR/><BR/>The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is superb, and I sit at the feet of Susan Sontag, who must have been the smartest person ever. I&#8217;m reading her essays, Against Interpretation.<BR/><BR/>My co-worker, Irene, tells a Susan Sontag story. Her sister&#8217;s husband was the only person at a camera company who Annie Leibovitz would deal with. They were invited to dinner at Annie&#8217;s house, and her sister remembers being introduced to &#8220;Susan someone&#8221; and having an enjoyable dinner together. Irene tears her hair out, moderately, in a New York kind of way.</div>

Me too. I also love the strong sense of place that grows in his later novels.<BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s interesting reading &#8220;Knots and Crosses&#8221; (the first one) after reading several more recent ones. He&#8217;s become a much better writer since then.</div>

Right now, I&#8217;m in a small café near the Universität der Künste Berlin. It&#8217;s obvious that great symphonies and the occasional revolution have been plotted here in caffeinated oblivion. The place has yellowing musical manuscripts on the walls and lit candles to go with my hot chocolate. Since I last wrote from Berlin, I&#8217;ve wandered around the city and seen many of the sights: two stand out.<br /><br />The first is the East Side Gallery, a painted remnant of the wall that&#8217;s about ten minutes walk from where I&#8217;m staying. The gallery extends at least a kilometre and is filled with colour, freedom, love and hope. I wish I could write down all that it made me feel, but I can&#8217;t reach quite that far yet.<br /><br />The second is a war memorial to all those who&#8217;ve died in any war, on the way to Brandenburg Tor from Alexanderplatz. From the outside, it&#8217;s a simple brown stone building. What&#8217;s impressive is the inside.<br /><br />As you walk through the door, you see a dark room with high ceilings. The floor and walls are the kind of black-grey that reminds you of smoke, ash and death. The room itself is bare except for a statue in the middle, that looks like a person sitting. You can&#8217;t make out the face or sex of the figuce, but you <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> she must be weeping for her dead child. When I first stepped in, the only thing I could think was, &#8220;Oh God, what have we done?&#8221;.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been in buildings that were supposed to elevate the mind toward heaven, in houses that we designed to make me feel at home, cafes that make me feel more creative than I am and even haunted houses designed to make me feel scared. Until this week, I&#8217;ve never been in a building that conjures up the mix of grief and horror that comes from knowing that something is deeply, deeply wrong the human race and that I am a part of it.</div>

Living in Canberra has some advantages in terms of national events: I feel very fortunate&#8230; nay *privileged*, to have been present for the entombment of the Unknown Solider at the War Memorial.<BR/>I have never since known Canberra to be so quiet; to be surrounded by so many people with tears streaming down their faces - myself among them - while the lone bugler played The Last Post.<BR/><BR/>Some things are unforgettable. Some things should never be forgotten.<BR/>Cheers</div>

One thing I didn&#8217;t mention in my first Berlin post was how terrifying I found the whole thing. It sounds silly now, but I was feeling more afraid than I have in quite some time — probably since my last job interview.<br /><br />When I left the hotel in London, I knew theoretically how to get to the Luton airport (Luton!) and from there to the Berlin and from there to the Ostbahnhof and from there to the hostel. But theory isn&#8217;t practice, and as Morpheus so wisely puts it, there&#8217;s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.<br /><br />So I spent the entire trip wondering what the hell I was doing and whether there would be a bed for me at the end of it all. There were momentary distractions while the plane was being shaken like an experimental cocktail, but overall doubt prevailed.<br /><br />Things got a lot worse when I left the Ostbahnhof (is this the right one?) and started walking up the Strasse der Pariser Kommune (is this the right way?). I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever walked in the dark before along a road you don&#8217;t know to a place you&#8217;ve never been. Whenever I&#8217;ve done it, time and distance seem to dilate: It can&#8217;t be <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> far away, surely? Maybe I&#8217;ve passed it already? What if the address on the website is wrong? Maybe places are numbered differently in Berlin? Were the photos on the hostel website a total lie?<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve ever been on a walk like this, you&#8217;ll know the joy of seeing clear street numbers in the right order, of first seeing your destination and finally arriving there. The hostel turns out to be as nice as the pictures, and the staff were so friendly it completely caught me off guard. I went to bed with clean linen, a fresh towel and a mind perfectly ready for sleep.</div>

Today I wandered around town on my own. I walked up Karl-Marx Allee until I reached Alexander Platz in Mitte. Once there, I climbed the tallest tower in the city and surveyed the realm that will soon be mine. There&#8217;s way too much fog here.<br /><br />I turned my gaze to the East and saw the buildings wrought by Stalin and the factories and the river. I saw the people&#8217;s park and ruins of an abbey and a clock that shows all the times of the world. My gaze turned West and the Tiergarten and the Dom and the Reichstag were among the things I beheld.<br /><br />I descended to the streets of the city and saw people cycling and shops slowly opening. Eventually one shop offered me a European power adapter, which I accepted with gratitude and humility. Thus exhausted, I returned home on the U-Bahn, where I spoke partly in German and partly in English with an eighty-year old woman who studied theology years ago.<br /><br />Today, I&#8217;m tired and do not want to do anything. Let&#8217;s see what happens.</div>

Decisions are funny things. Yesterday, if I had to decide whether to stay a week in a hostel in a foreign city I would have said &#8220;No, I want to go home&#8221;, but I&#8217;m here thanks to a decision I made months ago.  We&#8217;ll see how that one works out.<br /><br />Right now, I&#8217;m going to explore the city, perhaps even on an organized tour.</div>

Awesome, I&#8217;d love to go to Berlin. Some people think organised tours are tacky and limited. They are, I suppose, but I think you&#8217;ve got to embrace them. They can be an experience in themselves.<BR/><BR/>Hope you&#8217;re going well over there.</div>

Finally, the Launchpad Epic is over. It&#8217;s been two weeks of very intense activity, with training, workshops, arguments, presentations, lightning talks and pirate costumes.<br /><br />The training was dull but everything else was really good. I did a couple of lightning talks and one full-length presentation, and people seemed to like all them.<br /><br />I&#8217;m continually amazed at what a cool company I work for. There are so many smart, competent, interesting people in the same room, actually getting things done.<br /><br />Now I need to figure out how to get to my hostel in Berlin&#8230;</div>

It&#8217;s the end of a long, weird and dreary Saturday in London. I&#8217;m sitting in the hotel bar, trying hard not to work on my slides. I don&#8217;t know if I can explain exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> today felt so strange. I think perhaps everything takes on a quirky double life when you are tired under a sky that&#8217;s boiling apocalyptic grey.<br /><br />So far, the trip&#8217;s been good. It&#8217;s energizing being with the rest of <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/%7Elaunchpad">the Launchpad team</a> again. It&#8217;s the first time this year that we&#8217;ve all been awake at the same time, let alone in the same room. If you&#8217;ve never been to a sprint, it&#8217;s hard to explain. The buzz is not just from meeting old friends, it&#8217;s also from the feeling that now we can <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> get down to business.<br /><br />In any case, things have been so busy that I haven&#8217;t had any time to stop and think, and it&#8217;s the sort of busy that&#8217;s not always interesting to report. Right now, I&#8217;m going to go back to working on my slides and recuperating: the next week looms.</div>
