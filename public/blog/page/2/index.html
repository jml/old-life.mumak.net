Bice and I agreed that for this post we&#8217;d discuss our thoughts and reflections on the Alphabet Supremacy project so far. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s mine, which mostly date from about the end of March.<br /><h3>Writing process</h3><ul><li>Knowing that I&#8217;m going to write something every week means that I&#8217;m somewhat okay with writing and publishing something that I&#8217;m not happy with. &nbsp;Part of the exercise is acquiring the discipline of getting something out.</li><li>Also, I&#8217;m treating the whole thing as exercise rather than performance. That is, I&#8217;m using it as an excuse to try things, or to get better at things that I&#8217;ve struggled with.</li><li>This makes me particularly grateful to readers who actually continue to read. Thank you.</li><li>Although it&#8217;s not part of the rules, I&#8217;m avoiding using the bullet-point style that I prefer. That&#8217;s particularly because I want to exercise writing long form prose that&#8217;s coherent.</li><li>As I work on something, I very much wish that I could work on it more.</li><li>In particular, many, many ideas get discarded, some of which are better than the thing that gets published. &nbsp;Alas, time.</li><li>Also, I&#8217;m starting to learn to identify when I take the lazy way out in writing and also thinking. &nbsp;</li><li>I often want to write &#8220;Perhaps X&#8221; or &#8220;Maybe Y&#8221;, and when I do, it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t taken the time or made the effort to evaluate X or Y.</li><li>Sometimes I&#8217;ve had what I thought were interesting ideas, and then spent a lot of time developing them and then they turn out to be trite &amp; obvious. And then I delete them, and no one notices.</li><li>Composing an essay so that it has an actual&nbsp;<i>point</i>&nbsp;is rather hard.</li><li>Writing on a topic that&#8217;s chosen for me is a great way to get ideas for something,&nbsp;<i>anything</i>&nbsp;else to write. &nbsp;Making the time to develop those ideas is quite hard.</li><li>As a matter of principle, I think that most writers or speakers must first be entertainers. Perhaps some people are exceptions, but I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m one of them.&nbsp;</li><li>Why do we have principles? So we can constantly feel like failures and hypocrites.</li><li>Despite the fact that the whole reason I&#8217;m doing this is that I want to get better, I&#8217;m regularly surprised by just how hard it is to say what I mean.</li><li>I really want to be an essayist, but this far in, I think I prefer my fiction pieces more (in particular, <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/bargain.html">Bargain</a> and <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/05/indifference.html">Indifference</a>)</li></ul><h3>Interaction with Bice</h3><div><ul><li>Although it&#8217;s not a competition, I do make a bit of an internal decision about whether my post or Bice&#8217;s is the better one. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t been keeping score though, which is most likely a sub-conscious reaction to having a lower score.</li><li>I don&#8217;t read Bice&#8217;s post until I&#8217;ve published mine. &nbsp;I accidentally did so once, and that made it very difficult for me to write mine.</li><li>We do sometimes talk about posts and our thinking process after we&#8217;ve written them. Most of this discussion has been logged, and it might be interesting to review &amp; perhaps publish it some time toward the end of the project.</li></ul><h3>Word Choice</h3></div><div><ul><li>Sometimes I choose words because they&#8217;ll be easy for me to write about. Sometimes because I want to see what Bice has to say. Other times because I want to be forced to write about something in particular.&nbsp;</li><li>At least once, I&#8217;ve chosen a word because I could see opportunities for both fiction and non-fiction pieces.</li><li>We don&#8217;t collude over the choice of words (except for this one!). &nbsp;We sometimes talk about it after the choice (e.g. I recently asked if &#8220;football&#8221; was deliberately chosen to make this week&#8217;s post difficult for me), but we don&#8217;t discuss what we&#8217;re planning to write.</li></ul></div><h3>Pragmatics</h3><ul><li>Writing a post takes between two and six hours of actually sitting at a laptop, writing and editing.</li><li>With my current schedule, that&#8217;s a significant but manageable amount of time. &nbsp;It mostly means I have to do less open source hacking, and do fewer spontaneous fun things on the weekend.</li><li>When I&#8217;m sick, or I have a busy weekend, or I&#8217;m travelling, it&#8217;s much harder to get something done.</li><li>Blogger isn&#8217;t a fun platform to compose on.</li><li>I&#8217;ve already missed multiple deadlines.</li><li>Jolie has been a huge help to me in getting these posts out. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t overstate this.</li><li>I would love the opportunity to spend a few months working a piece that I cared about. &nbsp;However, a few months of full time writing would probably drive me mad. &nbsp;And I&#8217;d almost certainly procrastinate until the last week anyway.</li></ul><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

Ugh, no, sorry.  I wrote this before flying to the States and the word choice got lost in the timezone transition.<br /><br />Am struggling to think of anything to write about that I&#39;d actually find interesting.  How about &quot;negotiation&quot;.</div>

When I was child, I never really thought of vanilla as a flavour. &nbsp;Chocolate, strawberry and triple swirl were all obviously real flavours, but vanilla wasn&#8217;t really. &nbsp;It didn&#8217;t even have a colour. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just the flavour of ice cream you use when you don&#8217;t want to be too distracted from the main event, as when eating apple pie.<br /><br />For a long time I used to think of the piano like a bit like vanilla ice cream. &nbsp;Sure it&#8217;s fine in its place, but it&#8217;s just the default instrument. I&#8217;m not sure why anyone would choose it over, say, chocolate&#8212;er, I mean, the cello.<br /><br />But one day I realized that vanilla was more than just the absence of flavour, and that it actually was a pretty good flavour, and how exactly was it to blame if it went so well with everything, and if you don&#8217;t mind I might just have some vanilla ice cream by itself thank you very much. &nbsp;Likewise, I&#8217;m starting to enjoy to listening to the piano for its own sake.<br /><br />Well, a little. &nbsp;One of my favourite pieces of music is Brahms&#8217; Cello Sonata in E Minor. &nbsp;During the last few listens my focus has moved away from the cello and toward the play between the cello and the piano. &nbsp;The dark, strong, forceful line of the cello is the espresso that is both cut and complemented by the (wait for it) vanilla ice cream of the piano. &nbsp;Molto affogato.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t know why I like that piece so much. &nbsp;I only picked it up because another piece on the disc is mentioned a lot in The Fionavar Tapestry and I wanted to know what it sounded like. I don&#8217;t like the books quite so much any more &#8211; pick your ice cream metaphor of choice &#8211; but I was entranced by them at the time, and perhaps that enchantment carried over, and when I listen to the sonatas on the album a part of me hears an echo of Pwyll and Loren and the rest.<br /><br />Meh. It&#8217;s just really good music.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

After seeing an amazing live performance a few years back, I&#39;ve become a bit of a fan of Beethoven&#39;s piano sonatas, esp. no.23 &quot;appassionata&quot; </div>

<br /><br />Seven ways I&#8217;m lazy.<br /><h3>Busyness as excuse</h3>I&#8217;ve been meaning to go to the gym to do some strength training. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, planning for it, and talking about it for weeks, but I haven&#8217;t actually managed to go regularly. Why?<br /><br />The thing that I&#8217;ve been telling myself is that I&#8217;ve got a lot going on already, what with church, kickboxing, a very interesting job, writing these pieces, wanting to spend time with my friends and family, and having many other projects I want to do.<br /><br />In fact, I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve been doing a crappy job with all of these things because it&#8217;s difficult to give them the focus and time that they deserve.<br /><h3>Perfectionism</h3>Regular readers of this blog know very well that I&#8217;m not suffering from crippling perfectionism. &nbsp;I publish a lot of things that are much less good than I&#8217;d like them to be, and quite a few blog posts that I think are fundamentally flawed. &nbsp;Sorry.<br /><br />Even so, I often let the desire for the perfect defeat the good. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s take going to the gym as an example again (it&#8217;s been on my mind). &nbsp;The best time to go is in the afternoon, and there are some dangers associated with heavy lifting in the morning. &nbsp;But going after work would put me in the rush, and going in the middle of the work afternoon would introduce a two hour interruption to my day. &nbsp;So better not to go at all, right?<br /><br />As thin as one-ply tissue paper that&#8217;s just been used.<br /><h3>Lack of structured rest</h3>Resting and relaxing properly is a necessary part of living life to the full. When I don&#8217;t get enough rest, eventually my brain starts working begrudgingly and my body starts to say &#8220;no&#8221;.<br /><br />If I get much less than seven hours sleep, I work much less effectively. Also, it&#8217;s very easy for me to drink enough that everything the next day is significantly harder than it is otherwise.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s always culpable Sloth when I stay up late or when I go out celebrating: life is more than work or duty. &nbsp;But some times I know that the consequence will be a whole day when I need to be productive and all I&#8217;ll be good for is watching cat videos.<br /><h3>Lack of attention</h3>We don&#8217;t fall into attentiveness, we have to pay it. &nbsp;It takes effort, and so much of the time I can&#8217;t be bothered to spend that effort.<br /><br />I really hate it when I do this, because it means doing two things crappily at the same time. &nbsp;I&#8217;m only partly enjoying whatever talk or meeting or conversation I&#8217;m in, and I&#8217;m only partly enjoying whatever email / daydream / conversation / article I&#8217;m distracting myself with. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a real sense in which a lack of attention denies life.<br /><h3>Procrastination</h3>Perhaps the most frequent way I&#8217;m lazy is by always picking the easiest and most pleasurable item on my todo list. &nbsp;I should be doing this thing that&#8217;s important and has a deadline, but that involves something awkward like learning or having a confrontational conversation or getting off the couch, so instead I&#8217;m doing to read this paper on scalable computing that I&#8217;ve been wanting to read for ages.<br /><br />This one is insidious because I can spend a whole day doing productive work, sometimes even work that&#8217;s beneficial to others, but still actually be lazy, because I&#8217;m avoiding things of greater importance or urgency.<br /><h3>Not taking initiative</h3>The canonical example is being out at UDS with a group of people who want to go to dinner but as a mass are entirely incapable of actually making it happen.<br /><br />When I see this happen, I almost always think &#8220;You know, if I just stepped up and took charge, they&#8217;d probably be grateful, and we&#8217;d get to eat sooner.&#8221; And then I think, &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent the whole day talking and listening and explaining and negotiating. &nbsp;Someone else can sort it out.&#8221;<br /><br />Another example: I&#8217;m writing this in Markdown right now. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll then paste it into blogger and then edit it to be formatted correctly. &nbsp;That&#8217;s stupid work for a human being to do, and I really ought to make a machine that does it for me. &nbsp;But that would involve holding myself to a higher standard, and switching into a different mode of work, and &#8230;<br /><h3>Number 7</h3>And you know what, sometimes I simply can&#8217;t be arsed.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">. Next week&#8217;s word is &#8220;music&#8221;.</span><br /></div>

			<div class='post'>
<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">You might remember a few weeks ago, I wrote that&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/02/things-i-wish-we-were-taught-in-school.html" style="background-color: white; color: #4183c4; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; max-width: 100%;" target="_blank">I wished I learned more about logic at school</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px;">, particularly applying logic to prose arguments about complex and messy topics.</span><br /><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">I&#8217;ve actually done a little bit of reading in this area, particularly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Straight-Crooked-Thinking-Yourself-ebook/dp/B004YD1S1E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370795838&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=straight+and+crooked+thinking" style="color: #4183c4; max-width: 100%;" target="_blank">Straight and Crooked Thinking</a>by Robert Thouless, which is a top notch book on the subject, filled with lots of examples.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">You can walk away from a book like that feeling fully armed to face the mountebanks, quacks, hucksters and purveyors of snake oil who are out there trying to prey on your gullibility with beguiling words and smooth ways. Or perhaps with your newly sharpened logical razor, you will make better decisions, using the powers of science and reason to solve all of the problems that face you. Just like Doctor Who.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">I certainly felt that way. Sadly, I didn&#8217;t live up to my visions of logical glory. Stephen Bond has written a&nbsp;<a href="http://plover.net/~bonds/bdksucks.html" style="color: #4183c4; max-width: 100%;" target="_blank">great piece</a>&nbsp;about this focusing on the moral side of things. I&#8217;d like to take a look at some of the pragmatic failure modes, focusing on three ways I&#8217;ve screwed up by being too zealous with my baloney detection kit.</div><h3>Awkward silence</h3><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Once I became conscious of all of the ways I could be wrong, suddenly it became very hard to say anything at all.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Was I really sure that the thing I was saying was true? How did I know? Did I use emotional language to make my point? Was I implying that a thing was true of all people when it was really only true of some?</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Much easier to say nothing at all.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Maybe that&#8217;s fine. I talk too much anyway, and it&#8217;s probably good to have something to staunch the flow.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">On the other hand, in some kinds of discussions – &#8220;crucial&#8221; confrontations, design critiques, brainstorming – what most parties want isn&#8217;t perfectly formed logical assertions, but simply to get everyone&#8217;s thoughts and questions on the table.</div><h3>Selective application</h3><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">It turns out I&#8217;m not great at tearing my own treasured beliefs to shreds. All of these logical tools are so much easier for me to apply when it&#8217;s about something I already disagree with.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">So if someone posts a thing about how shared mutable state is great, or how we should rewrite a functioning piece of software in a different language, or why we should kick out all of the immigrants, I whip out my baloney detection kit and point out their invalid sampling, their circular arguments, their appeals to moderation (also a fallacy!), their arguments of the beard and have at them. It&#8217;s great fun. I doubt it actually helps anyone, least of all me.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">This is double-edged suck. Not only do I miss the opportunity to learn from people who disagree with me, but I also miss the chance to gain a deeper understanding of the basis of my own opinions. If a belief is worth holding, it ought to be able to withstand a bit of rigorous scrutiny.</div><h3>Colossal prat</h3><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Finally, rather than being a champion of enlightenment, I found it way too easy to end up being a colossal prat.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">So often, people are just trying to express a half-formed idea and want their interlocutors to help it grow into something solid. Sometimes, they just want to have a conversation.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">I know this is really obvious to most of you, but sometimes I do forget. The other day, we were talking on IRC about how so much software sucks. Onei person chimed in, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s kind of silly to be angry for expecting too much&#8221;.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Gasp! He uttered a tautology! Of course it&#8217;s silly to be angry for expecting too much, that&#8217;s precisely what &#8220;too much&#8221; means. Strictly speaking the sentence adds nothing to the conversation.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">And yet, I knew what he meant. He meant that our expectations were too high and we should lower them and be happier, gentler people. But rather than agreeing or disagreeing with his actual point, I decided to put on my Logic Pants and point out his mistake.</div><div style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px; max-width: 100%;">Happily, he seemed to take it gracefully and his follow-up rephrasing carried genuine content.

A tour of a few keepsakes I have.<br /><br /><b>Lizzie</b><br /><br />When my sister Lizzie came back from her honeymoon, she brought me a small wooden carving of a man sitting down, his head tilted to the side and resting on the palm of his hand.<br /><br />He doesn&#8217;t have any facial features, but I&#8217;ve always imagined him to be quite glum, as if he has spent a long time alone chasing his thoughts and is pretending not to notice that they never go anywhere.<br /><br />When the gift was given, I had felt that way quite a lot of the time for quite a while, and it was about as much fun as it sounds. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just a little token and it&#8217;s likely I&#8217;m reading way too much into the gift (although maybe not!) but I was quite touched when I received it, and it&#8217;s sitting on our mantelpiece today.<br /><br /><b>Martin</b><br /><br />My primary school education was a little bit weird. &nbsp;It took a couple of years for everyone to agree that the standard curriculum was doing me more harm than good and to decide what to do about it. &nbsp;In the end, I was taken out of regular classes, became &#8220;non-graded&#8221; and was assigned to a teacher named Martin Chance. &nbsp;Whichever class he taught, I&#8217;d be there in the back, sometimes working with the class but mostly doing something else that he had assigned.<br /><br />He taught me Go, tried valiantly to make me a good chess player, insisted that I read things I didn&#8217;t like, which at the time included &#8220;The Tempest&#8221;, &#8220;A Coral Island&#8221; and &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221;. &nbsp;Where I wanted to focus on maths and programming, Martin insisted on teaching me philosophy, history and geography.<br /><br />Martin became a friend of the family, and after I finished primary school I&#8217;d still go over to his place to talk or to mow the lawn or whatever. &nbsp;Although in later years we drifted apart, I still consider him a great friend and can&#8217;t help but acknowledge the great positive influence he has been in my life.<br /><br />Which is pretty much the reason I keep a small wooden box with a pair of Baoding balls in it.<br /><br /><b>Tilly</b><br /><br />I love my nieces, and probably the worst thing about being an expat is that I only get to see them very rarely. &nbsp;The main reason I still have a Facebook account is because that&#8217;s the place I&#8217;m most likely to find new photos of them.<br /><br />We&#8217;ve yet to receive anything from Georgia, our youngest niece, but if you looked around our flat for long enough you would find a drawing of Aunty Jolie &amp; myself, standing underneath a London rainbow next to some flowers, as well as a cardboard canary, with wings made by cutting around the outlines of a pair of small hands.<br /><br /><b>Bice</b><br /><br />(Ah ha ha! Hoisted by your own petard!)<br /><br />Because sometimes it&#8217;s okay to conform unthinkingly to your gender stereotype, I haven&#8217;t owned a fluffy stuffed toy in years. &nbsp;I have Bice to thank for changing that.<br /><br />For a while, I&#8217;ve wanted to own a dog – a big dog, like a Newfoundland Terrier. &nbsp;But for all of that time, I haven&#8217;t felt as if I could responsibly own one. &nbsp;As a renter, I didn&#8217;t want to be forced to move somewhere I couldn&#8217;t have pets and I used to travel quite a lot for work.<br /><br />I explained this to Bice once. &nbsp;The way I put it was that my five year plan was to own a dog, and that getting a mortgage was a step in the middle.<br /><br />I also explained it to Joliette while we were courting each other. &nbsp;It&#8217;s important to make sure that you have the same priorities before making a commitment, no? &nbsp;She isn&#8217;t as set on a Newfie as I am, but we are both equally torn between our desire to keep living centrally in London and for a big, slobbering, canine friend.<br /><br />When Bice visited for our wedding, he somehow remembered our offhand conversation, and brought us a plush black Newfoundland, whom Jolie &amp; I promptly christened Mortgage.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

Getting a mortgage in order to own a dog at first sounds silly&#8230; but it&#39;s not.</div>

<br />I think most readers of this blog have already heard of <a href="http://hpmor.com/"><i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i></a>. It&#8217;s a long-running Harry Potter fanfic where our hero isn&#8217;t the slightly dopey jock aristocrat of Rowling&#8217;s books, but is instead a hyper-intelligent bookish kid with a penchant for logic, reason, the scientific method and world domination.<br /><br />If you haven&#8217;t read it, it&#8217;s perhaps not good enough to bump to the top of your queue, but is certainly a pleasant way of spending a long haul flight. Certainly I&#8217;ve read more than one published work of fiction that was far preachier and much less fun to read.<br /><br />It&#8217;s written by a chap named Eliezer Yudkowsky who helped found <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">Less Wrong</a>, a website notionally aimed at helping you &amp; I be more rational. There&#8217;s some pretty good stuff there, as well as plenty of things to take issue with. Others have done so <a href="http://plover.net/~bonds/cultofbayes.html">much better than I could</a>, but I&#8217;ve yet to read anything to take issue with the thing that bugs me the most: utilitarianism.<br /><br />Their pitch is that a rational agent will (and should? is &#8220;should&#8221; a thing?) choose a course of action most likely to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number. Simple enough, and a useful decision making tool for questions like &#8220;Should I bring a blue cheese or a bottle of wine to dinner?&#8221; or &#8220;Should we compel people to purchase insurance?&#8221;.<br /><br />Harry exemplifies this throughout &#8220;the Methods of Rationality&#8221;. He is remarkably consistent in choosing his actions based on his best understanding of the greatest good for the greatest number. He even has a crisis of conscience when he become unsure of whether carrots are sentient.<br /><br />Except, well, he&#8217;s not. At least, I don&#8217;t think he is.<br /><br />My suspicions were first raised in Azkaban. When Harry visits there and realizes what&#8217;s going on, he reacts with moral fury. Azkaban is not simply irrational, it is simply wrong for human beings to be treated this way. Deontological ethics if ever I heard any. After all, it&#8217;s entirely possible that keeping a subset of humanity locked up in awful conditions will maximize utility, no?<br /><br />But reading up on consequentialist ethics for this piece, I can see a way to restore him to utilitarian purity. Harry&#8217;s objection is not simply that it&#8217;s a prison, but one where <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/62">the prisoners are tortured to death</a>. He reacts with such passion because there&#8217;d be more utility if they weren&#8217;t being tortured, and either he doesn&#8217;t buy the argument that Dementor wardens is the only way to safely guard them, or he thinks that an ineffective prison would be better than such one staffed by Dementors.<br /><br />Even earlier than Azkaban, but only discovered by me while working on this piece, there&#8217;s a scene where <a href="http://hpmor.com/chapter/47">Draco tries to enlist Harry to aide him against the murderer of Draco&#8217;s mother</a>, who was burnt alive. Harry eventually agrees to make this person his enemy, given five conditions.<br /><br />One of the conditions is that the deal might be off if the killing were a revenge killing. That is, if Narcissa did something awful. Why?<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Because then it was still wrong for them to burn her, they still should&#8217;ve just killed her without pain; but it wasn&#8217;t evil the same way as if she was just Lucius&#8217;s love who never did anything herself, like you said.</blockquote>I agree, but my ethics are sloppy and largely deontological. How does it make sense for a utilitarian to decide whether or not to administer justice based on the flavour of evil in the motive?<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, a Google search for &#8220;mens rea utilitarian&#8221; reveals the answer on a <a href="http://quizlet.com/7154997/crim-law-midterm-mens-rea-flash-cards/">criminal law mid-term flash card</a>.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">A person who commits the actus reus [guilty act] of an offense without a mens rea [guilty mind] is not dangerous, could not have been deterred, and is not in need of reform, therefore, their punishment would be counterutilitarian.</blockquote>Perhaps this is what Harry is thinking of. I&#8217;m sceptical though. The language that Harry uses in his negotiations with Draco are clearly not consequentialist, but primarily concerned with doing what is right, and throughout the <i>Methods of Rationality</i>, Yudkowsky freeloads off deontological sentiment while espousing a consequentialist worldview.<br /><br />Even so, it&#8217;s a much more difficult opinion to skewer than I had imagined, which rather sabotages my plans to end this with a glib note about how truly <i>just</i> punishment must be at least partly retributive, per C. S. Lewis&#8217;s essay on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/pro/lewiscs/humanitarian.html">Humanitarian Theory of Punishment</a>.<br /><br />Clearly I&#8217;m going to have to go back to my books and figure out just what I actually think. What a bother.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

How would we live if we knew that sometime in our life, all of our debt would be cancelled? If there was a known date in the future when everything we owe to anyone else would be forgotten, and when we would be obliged to forgive anything anyone owed us?<br /><br />That is the gist of the Year of Jubilee, which you can read all about in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2025%20&amp;version=NIV">Leviticus 25</a>&nbsp;if you should so desire. Every fifty years, debts are forgiven, slaves are freed, land is returned to its original owners, the slate is wiped clean.<br /><br /><br />This makes a lot of sense. Unless you are living in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atlas-Shrugged-Centennial-Edition-ebook/dp/B003V8B5XO/">a fictional paradise</a>, poverty can come from things other than laziness, incompetence, and government intervention: accidents happen, people get sick, and land is not always abundant. When such things happen – and they do, over and over – the poor sell off their land, or simply borrow money from the rich. This eases their current situation but reduces their income, leaving them more vulnerable to the next disaster.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thus, most Jubilee laws come with words about how they protect widows and orphans, and the poor from the rich. They rebalance society, they – I&#8217;ve never felt my lack of an economic education more keenly than now – restore to the workers the ownership of the means of production.<br /><br /><br />That said, it&#8217;s not clear whether the law was ever implemented. The Biblical record is silent (to my knowledge), and we&#8217;re not exactly drowning in extra-biblical sources for ancient Israeli history. To my modern sensibility, the idea is unsettling. Wouldn&#8217;t people just go on massive credit card sprees? Would it become impossible to get a mortgage in year forty-nine? As an Australian, it&#8217;s even slightly alarming. Just who are the original owners to whom land should be returned?<br /><br />At least <a href="http://michael-hudson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/HudsonLostTradition.pdf">one guy on the Internet</a> claims there are evidences of similar laws &amp; decrees elsewhere in the Near East, and thus that even if Israel never implemented a Jubilee, it&#8217;s likely that Babylon and Sumer did.<br /><br />David Graeber, author of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Debt-First-000-Years-ebook/dp/B00513DGIO/">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</a>&nbsp;</i>(the most thought-provoking book I read in 2012), argues that we should institute a Jubilee now, for both international debt and consumer debt. To those who say &#8220;surely one has to pay ones debts&#8221;, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZIINXhGDcs">he points out</a> that part of the deal of lending money out at interest is that you might not ever get your money back. When you spot a struggling third world country a couple of billion, only to see them have a military coup followed by years of famine, well, perhaps it&#8217;s time to write that one off, rather than demand interest payments from the destitute nation for the next few decades. Oh to be able to run an experimental fork of the world economy.<br /><br />If we just did it for consumer debt in a rich nation, such as Britain, and we somehow figured out to whom land ought to return – a tricky question that Graeber avoids – what would happen next?<br /><br />My imagination fails me. Cynically, I think there&#8217;d be a temporary dip in the finance sector until the City boys figured out how to create an instrument that lasted over the Jubilee. In a sense, a debt is just a precisely defined obligation, just information. It&#8217;s not a coincidence that the earliest writing we have are records of credit. To erase debt in Sumer, they literally washed the tablets, smoothing the cuneiform dimples from it until it was just clay. Getting rid of information these days is trickier.<br /><br />Got any thoughts yourself? I&#8217;m very interested in this topic but, as mentioned, have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. Feel free to comment here or on G+.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

Arnold the Wanderer reclined back in his chair, hugging a hot cup of tea with his hands. &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t as he normally liked it, but it was hot, and that was an important thing. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m at all ungrateful for your hospitality,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but what or who exactly is this temple for?&#8221;<br /><br />The monk&#8217;s face lit up with a special glee. &#8220;Oh, no, not at all. &nbsp;We welcome the chance to share the particularities of our message with any who earnestly seek the path&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t quite call myself a seeker, you know. Just a fellow who&#8217;s a bit baffled.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; the monk spread his hands and smiled, relishing a rare chance to nod sagely, &#8220;all too well do I remember the confusion of the unenlightened.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;No, no – well, yes, maybe – but what religion are you?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;We are the followers of Bel Shang-Gur, and we strive to walk in his path.&#8221;<br /><br />Arnold had wandered the earth for years, and had spoken to many mystics, demagogues, hermits, hierophants and sarcedotes. He had never heard of Bel Shang-Gur, and said as much.<br /><br />&#8220;Bel Shang-Gur was originally not a holy man, but a prosperous merchant in a city far south of here. One afternoon, as he was walking down its streets, arm in arm with his wife, she, in her ignorance, asked him the First Unanswerable Question, planting the seed of our whole order.<br /><br />&#8216;What would you like to do tonight?&#8217;<br /><br />As Bel Shang-Gur heard those words, he saw a single blossom fall from one of the linden trees that lined the street. Although he had heard those words hundreds of times before, a new and spiritual understanding dawned within him.<br /><br />&#8216;I don&#8217;t know, what would you like to do?&#8217;<br /><br />On instinct! So early! Simple words, and yet so profound! He had discovered the Second Unanswerable Question, the second vertex of the mystery on which our order is founded.&#8221;<br /><br />Arnold the Wanderer did his best to nod sagely.<br /><br />&#8220;Does your neck trouble you, seeker?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Uh, no. Carry on.&#8221;<br /><br />The monk was frothing over like a glass of beer with a sugar cube in. &#8220;He saw that it was his will – to want or to not want – that divided him from the cosmos. That the blossom, resigned to its fate and carried by the wind was truly at peace. From that day forth, he resolved to cultivate an indifference to all things, and to pass on this serenity to all who would listen.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Here in Abbey of the Holy Apathy, we train ourselves to follow his path. First, we rid ourselves of preference and inclination, then anticipation and nostalgia, then appetite and desire, and finally attaining to a volitional void. &nbsp;&#8216;Blessed is he who truly doesn&#8217;t mind either way&#8217;.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Truly, your way is an arduous one.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh yes! For the first year, our brother monks are instructed to mispronounce our names. It is only when the vexation is cleansed from our hearts that we are permitted to truly begin as novitiates.&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;And have you gone far on your journey to enlightenment?&#8221;<br /><br />The monk visibly slumped. &#8220;It is a hard path to walk. Just yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t remember what I had for breakfast, which was a big step for me. I had porridge today though. Brother Kells most days can&#8217;t remember whether he even had breakfast, the jammy bastard.&#8221;<br /><br />Seeing Arnold&#8217;s&nbsp;querulous&nbsp;gaze, the monk remembered himself and rose serenely. &#8220;Seeker, would you like another cup of tea?&#8221;<br /><br />&#8220;Oh, yes please! But could I have it with two sugars this time?&#8221; &nbsp;The monk&#8217;s face turned ashen.<br /><br />&#8220;Dark indeed are the ways of the unenlightened.&#8221;<br /><div><br /></div><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

	</header>
		<div class="content">

If I were to be marooned on a desert island and were allowed a single physical object to console me in my exile, that object would almost definitely be underpants. Should my captors show me mercy and treat clothes as a given, then I would probably ask for my Kindle. And a solar-powered USB charger, of course. Although why they would deign to let me take an item onto this rocky outcrop of doom is as much a mystery to me as why they would stick me there in the first place. But if it were three items, then it would definitely be my Kindle, a charger, and spare set of clean pants.<br /><br />Taking a Kindle renders the traditional dinner party question moot. The whole point – other than allowing everyone at the table a chance to briefly fantasize about escaping the present company – is to learn something of your companions. When someone chooses say, the Bible, <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, and a Wodehouse omnibus, you learn that he (or she – but you can probably guess in this case who the hypothetical someone actually is), then you learn that he (or she) is a devout person with a passion for redemption narratives and tweed-core comedy. Or at least that this is what he wishes you to think of him.<br /><br />When our unlucky fellow diner picks a Kindle, you don&#8217;t get any of that. The best we can tell is that by picking an ebook reader over an iPod that he&#8217;s probably not a music person. Or it could be that he values personal hygiene over a set of headphones. You just can&#8217;t tell.<br /><br />More interesting to me is why we have all been sent to this desert island in the first place under such bizarre terms. How would we get there? <i>Lost</i>&nbsp;notwithstanding, modern communications technology rules out an accidental, Gilligan scenario. There must be some kind of intent. And let&#8217;s face it, whoever is abandoning us to the elements probably doesn&#8217;t exactly have our best interests at heart. Were they benevolent, there&#8217;d be much better ways of expressing it. They could give us an ice cream. Their intent, therefore, must be malicious.<br /><br />But why an island, rather than say, Wolverhampton? Why not just do us in? And why offer us comforts in a way that is both absurdly generous and yet so arbitrarily limited.<br /><br />One of the other guests has to be in on it. This is the only thing that makes sense. This guest employs agents who then strand us in different islands across the globe, making it look to each of us as if he (or she) were a hapless victim. An island, rather than a not particularly interesting city, much reduces the likelihood that we&#8217;ll ever be able to get back and inform on them – assuming any of us figures it out.<br /><br />And, presumably since we&#8217;re all at the same table together, we are all friends, or friends of friends, or (if we&#8217;re particularly unlucky) family. Thus it&#8217;s likely that this Judas in our midst shares kith or kin with us who he&#8217;d rather not bereave. Hence exile, not execution.<br /><br />No other explanation makes any sense.<br /><br />Next time someone asks you this question, be very suspicious. And don&#8217;t forget to ask about the pants. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span></div>

You are to be marooned on a Desert Island with a 1st generation iPod. You are given the chance to rip 11 CDs to .wav format. There are exits to the North and South. To the East is a hand operated moveable-type  press.<br /><br />&gt;&#8230;</div>

<br />I&#8217;ve been fascinated by English history since I first watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044760/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><i>Ivanhoe</i></a>&nbsp;as a young boy. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve got knights and barons and druids and archers and juries and parliaments and roses and Roundheads and Romans and Robin Hood. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve nefarious hunchbacks and mad kings and warrior queens. &nbsp;Who could ask for anything more?<br /><br />And, despite being <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fatal-Shore-Robert-Hughes/dp/0099448548/">Australian</a>, I think of British history as <i>my</i> history. Well, at least up until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet">1788</a>, and maybe even up until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federation">1901</a>. This partly comes from my mother &amp; her family being British emigrants and partly from consuming lots of British media, like the aforementioned Ivanhoe.<br /><br />Of course, technically I&#8217;m not British, I&#8217;m Irish. &nbsp;Mum was born in Dublin, and thus I&#8217;m an Irish citizen. &nbsp;When we were young she used to talk about her Irish granny and her thick Irish brogue and what not, but if ever our family talked about the Old Country (we didn&#8217;t) then really it&#8217;s Middlesex, England. I ended up with a vaguely English accent, which has only got worse (better) since moving to London.<br /><br />Certainly I didn&#8217;t know any of the stories of Ireland, at least not beyond St. Patrick. &nbsp;I could spin you a yarn about Captain Cook discovering the world, or Elizabeth I defeating the Spanish armada, or the noble, Christian Romano-Celts bravely failing to hold off an invasion from the smelly, pagan Germanic tribes, or the Jacobites toasting the King over the water, or Saxon peasants farming cows in order to serve the Norman lords their boeuf, but precious little about Ireland. &nbsp;So for a long time I was on the lookout for a book about Irish history, one that would give me an overview of the whole thing.<br /><br />The closest one I&#8217;ve found wasn&#8217;t <i>exactly</i> about Irish history, but was a fascinating book nonetheless. &nbsp;It&#8217;s <i>The Isles</i> by Norman Davies, and it aims to be a history of the British Isles spanning from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXzzHM8zLw">dawn of time</a>&nbsp;to the present day. There are three unusual things about it that are worth calling out.<br /><br />The first is that Davies is deliberately setting out to redress an imbalance in the way British history is taught. &nbsp;According to him, what is currently called British history is really <i>English</i>&nbsp;history. &nbsp;This seems true enough to me. &nbsp;The Magna Carta, Boadicea and Cromwell all have next to nothing to do with Scotland or Ireland [availability heuristic]. &nbsp;Hence the title, which<br />specifically avoids labelling the archipelago on which your correspondent&#8217;s posterior is now comfortably planted. It is the central conceit of the book: he tries to tell an Irish history together with an English history, a Scottish history and a Welsh history.<br /><br />He takes it further though, seizing every opportunity he can to point out this confusion at the heart of British identity. &nbsp;In his discussion of the Victorian era, he even goes to the lengths of referring to an English &#8220;inner empire&#8221; which forms the blueprint for the British &#8220;outer empire&#8221;. &nbsp;He points out that Shakespeare got his geography wrong when he called England &#8220;this scepter&#8217;d isle&#8221;, and that the thing that makes <i>Land of Hope and Glory</i> work is that the land in question is conveniently left unspecified.<br /><br />The second quirk is in Davies&#8217;s nomenclature. &nbsp;He insists on trying to spell the names of people and places the way they would have. &nbsp;Thus, William the Conquerer is always &#8220;Guillaume&#8221; because he was French, you know. &nbsp;It does not work at all in the pre-historic parts (the &#8220;Midnight Isles&#8221;? Really?), but works surprisingly well once history actually gets going. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t help but think of King James I of England differently when you are &nbsp;reminded every time his name is mentioned that he always signed himself &#8220;Jacques&#8221;.<br /><br />Third, he bangs on about Europe. Instead of keeping his island history properly insular, he is constantly referring to how political and economic forces on the mainland – I mean, the Continent – have driven events in Britain and Ireland. It&#8217;s almost as if he thinks that the Sleeve – sorry, the Channel – is small enough to swim across.<br /><br />It&#8217;s these three things that make <i>The Isles</i>&nbsp;what it is. &nbsp;Whether people praise it or condemn it, they generally do so for these three reasons. Otherwise, the book is entertaining and well written. &nbsp;Since I was reading it to cure myself of ignorance I am the worst possible judge of its accuracy. The best I can say there is that whatever fibs Davies tells are at least plausible. &nbsp;It is colossally heavy though, so if you can get an electronic copy, do so.<br /><br />If you don&#8217;t have the time, may I suggest <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/1066-All-That-W-C-Sellar/dp/0413772705/">1066 and All That</a>&nbsp;</i>instead?<br /><br />Next week&#8217;s word: island.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.</span><br /></div>
