The most visceral memory I have of our trip to New York a couple of weeks ago was on a walk Jolie &amp; I took along the Hudson River.<br /><br />Jolie&#8217;s friends recommended a bunch of places for us to go see. We were just coming from one of them, a downtown pizza joint that we were slowly waddling away from, leaving behind a confused server and two-thirds of the one and only pizza we ordered. Never order a pizza in America unless there are at least five people around who are willing to give you a hand.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#8217;re walking down the Hudson, hand-in-hand in the moonlight on our way to a bar that runs in a converted ship, when our path is crossed by this huge rat, just sitting there on the footpath underneath the lights. He didn&#8217;t look like he was doing much, just chilling out on the river, enjoying the breeze.<br /><br />I actually don&#8217;t know if he was huge as rats go, since that&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve seen. At first, I thought it was a slightly bulky chihuahua. When we figured out what it was, I was a bit surprised it wasn&#8217;t busy inducting its turtle friends in the mysteries of ninjitsu. If I&#8217;d known, I would have brought them pizza.<br /><br />All the while, it&#8217;s just sitting there, bold as brass and in no mind to move off the footpath. I hadn&#8217;t been in New York long enough to insist on my right of way, so I navigated us gently around Master Splinter and resumed our night-time amble toward wobbly-decked drinks, glancing over my shoulder very occasionally – only every three seconds or so – to make sure that no rodent horde was pursuing us.<br /><br />I went to New York with a bit of a preconception that the natives were a bit rude, always in a hurry and more than willing to let you know about it. I didn&#8217;t find it that way. The dog-sized rat there was easily the rudest New Yorker we met, and he was surprisingly relaxed for a repellent pest that&#8217;s loathed by all and sundry. I guess he knew there were plenty worse places to be than in Manhattan in the moonlight.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">This post is part of the <a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html">Alphabet Supremacy</a>, a collaboration with <a href="http://life.metagnome.net/">Bice Dibley</a>.

&#8220;Yes, but things are different in the real world.&#8221;<br /><br />It&#8217;s perhaps not <i>the </i>most patronizing thing you can say to someone, but it&#8217;s close to being the most patronizing thing anyone has said to me. (And I am deeply aware, gentle reader, that it is a privilege for me to be able to say so).<br /><br />When I was at school, I was told the real world was and would be different. After I got online, people reminded me that I needed to spend time in the real world. When I went to university, graduates in full-time employment assumed an air of superior knowledge and sagely informed me that the real world was a different place. When I started work and my colleagues found out I was into open source software, they were happy to tell me how that sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t work in the real world. When later I started work at Canonical, more than one person would patiently explain to me that sooner or later the pressures of the real world would cause the company to collapse. Now, at Google, I occasionally hear people joke about how it&#8217;s scary out there in the real world since you have to pay for your food out there.<br /><br />There is exactly one real world. It is the world that we are all living, breathing, eating and sleeping in. We have never in our lives left the real world. Each and every day has been spent within its confines, and it will be so every day until we go to our graves. If it turns out that there is life after that, then that too will be as real as today.<br /><br />Is it possible that the very fabric of the universe shifts and alters at the gates of academia? That friends in the schoolyard mean less than friends in the workplace? Is it really true that being a jerk to someone online is somehow less real than being a jerk to someone standing next to you? Perhaps the laws of physics are suspended at Google, allowing the chefs to conjure food from the ether.<br /><br />No. It&#8217;s very clear what people actually mean when they say &#8220;the real world&#8221;. They mean &#8220;my world&#8221;, and add to it the sheer effrontery of suggesting that only their experience and the experience of those like them has any validity whatsoever.<br /><br />To tell someone that things are different in the real world is to deny them an authentic experience of reality. That which you have lived through is of less value than that which I have lived through. My concerns have weight, yours are ephemeral. My achievements are solid, yours are imagined. I have the boldness to face the truth and all of its harsh consequences, while you wrap yourself in the warm blanket of pleasant delusion. I matter, you do not.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t bear any grudge if you use the phrase to compare and contrast obviously imagined worlds to reality. For example, &#8220;in Tolkien&#8217;s Middle Earth, the Silmarils and later the Rings of Power are central, and the lives of thousands turn on them. In the real world, jewellery is rarely that important&#8221;. If you said that, we might go on to have a spirited discussion about the diamond industry, but I wouldn&#8217;t object to your phrasing.<br /><br />However, if you say something daft like &#8220;Well, all of this open source software is well and good but in the real world we have to think about money&#8221;, then I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to be difficult for us to converse further.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">.

Sometimes I wonder how <i>The Flash</i>&nbsp;can stand it. Not only does he have to struggle through life wearing the world&#8217;s most ridiculous hat, but he must spend subjective aeons of time forced to watch the rest of us faff.<br /><br />Imagine you&#8217;re Barry Allen, aka <i>The Flash</i>, and you&#8217;ve got guests over for dinner. It&#8217;s time for coffee and you realize all of a sudden that you don&#8217;t have any milk. &#8220;No problem&#8221;, you think, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just nip out to the shops and get some&#8221;. After all, you sip from the well of the Speed Force, how long could it possibly take?<br /><br />But on the way down the stairs from your apartment, a large couple have decided to stop on the stair case and have an argument about whether or not they actually did buy bacon when they were out at the supermarket. Now, their conversation takes maybe only fifteen or twenty seconds, but if you can move and react a hundred-thousand times faster than a regular human, then that&#8217;s equivalent to almost a month.<br /><br />Now, I&#8217;m not suggesting that the Flash is stuck in a time stream that moves much, much slower than hours and that he is always watching us continentally drift through our lives. But even so, when he&#8217;s waiting in line at a supermarket, he <i>could </i>by doing something else. In fact, he could be doing, much, much more. For every instant in his stream of consciousness, he is presumably making a decision to not rush ahead and get all of everyone&#8217;s shopping scanned and packed in 7.42s so he can get back to fighting crime or watching Breaking Bad or whatever it is that he actually does. Even if he has some control over how he perceives the flow of time, the crucial thing is that he always <i>knows</i> that he could be going faster if only people would just hurry up a little.<br /><br />It turns out that I am not a patient man, and that I&#8217;m indulging myself by project myself onto DC&#8217;s fastest hero, albeit sans hat. I am all in favour of languorous leisure time, but I see no reason why one should dawdle when filling out forms, and can find no excuse for the person who has waited fifteen minutes in a bank queue only to arrive at the teller entirely unprepared for the experience. There is a time and a place to stop and smell the roses, and it is in a rose garden, not in your local branch of Lloyds TSB. When a dozen people behind you are on the last famished legs of their lunch break, more conscious than ever of their mortality, then one ought to push the tempo.<br /><br />But what an ugly way to live, to be always and ever mildly irked at all the poor souls who haven&#8217;t put as much time and energy into learning the fastest way to use a self-checkout as I have. I don&#8217;t even have to play the &#8220;well, they might have just come from the doctors with terrible news&#8221; game to see it&#8217;s wrong. While it&#8217;s true that you never know what&#8217;s going on in someone&#8217;s head, and that Fundamental Attribution Error is a real thing, and there is only one true judge, that still doesn&#8217;t help me, because that still leaves some people who are slow with no excuse and in my way.<br /><br />What I need to remember are the people who&#8217;ve patiently waited for me to figure things out after I&#8217;ve made the same mistake again &amp; again, the people who&#8217;ve waiting for me to (literally) stop standing on their feet, to (figuratively) stop making an ass of myself, to realize exactly what it was I just said, to say sorry, for me to be sorry.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="-webkit-transition: color 0.3s; background-color: white; color: #009eb8; display: inline; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none; text-align: justify; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">.

There&#8217;s really no way to say this without offending some folk, so I&#8217;m going to go ahead and say it straight. Pasta is the Coldplay of the food world: bland, over-played filler squarely aimed at deluding the bourgeoisie into thinking they&#8217;ve got an creative edge.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll admit there are very rare circumstances, a bowl of freshly made pasta with a simple sauce can be a dish to nourish the soul as well as the body. Sadly, these circumstances almost never arrive, and instead we – the people – are forever saddled with squeaky, squishy, off-white starch, passing itself off as a meal. No food should have to pass itself as a bow-tie in order to be eaten.<br /><br />Macaroni &amp; cheese, you say? Jacket potato says I. Lasagne? Why not pizza. Your play is spaghetti bolognese, but I&#8217;ll counter with chicken tikka masala.<br /><br />I&#8217;m coming on strong to make a point. I don&#8217;t actually <i>hate</i>&nbsp;the stuff, and certainly won&#8217;t think less of you if you happen to like pasta. Or Coldplay, even. It&#8217;s just not my scene.<br /><br />Now, although the chances are undoubtedly slimmed after publishing this despicably graceless blog post, if you happen to invite me around for dinner at your place and we end up munching on tagliatelle and listening to <i>Parachutes</i>, I won&#8217;t utter a word of complaint and will eat up everything you deign to put on my plate. I&#8217;m a bigot, not a brute. I would be so gobsmacked with gratitude that mere details as to which starch – musical or nutritional – we choose to fill ourselves with will pale into insignificance.<br /><br />After all – and I am at least eighty percent serious about this – what&#8217;s the point of living if we can&#8217;t enjoy the company of our friends at the dinner table? Cold nights with warm, comforting food (I really don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s pasta, potatoes, polenta, pumpkin or parsnips), enough wine to gently lift the heart and pleasant company to make it all worthwhile.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">.

Last week, I mentioned that I&#8217;m on a roster at Christ Church Mayfair. &nbsp;This week, although &#8220;protect&#8221; too grandiose a word for it, I&#8217;d like to share a bit about what it is actually do, and why.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, my job is to keep people out of church, and to make sure that those in the service don&#8217;t disrupt it. &nbsp;If you think of the role as a bouncer, you wouldn&#8217;t be too far off.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not typical for churches to have a rota of bouncers. &nbsp;Generally speaking, we&#8217;d like as many people through the door as we can possibly get – we call it &#8220;good news&#8221; for a reason. &nbsp;Hosting an evening service in central London, however, means that we often get people who turn up who for one reason or another are best turned away.<br /><br />The most common and the most benign are tourists who want to look at the building. &nbsp;CCM is a traditional church building that was built by the Victorians and survived the blitz. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also the closest churchy looking building to a bunch of very expensive hotels. &nbsp;Plenty of tourists want to have a peek inside. &nbsp;If they want to join the service, they are most welcome, but if they just want to take snapshots of the ceiling, we&#8217;d rather they come back some other time.<br /><br />We also occasionally get people who are there with the express intent of disrupting the service, shouting and angry or shouting and mocking as the case may be. &nbsp;Occasionally they&#8217;re rich lads on a night out, but mostly this comes from rough sleepers with untreated mental illnesses. &nbsp;I really don&#8217;t know what do for those guys, except to be kind and patient and make sure they don&#8217;t come inside unless they calm down first.<br /><br />I have to stress, we don&#8217;t refuse people based on how they look, how rich or poor they are, whether they are on a list (there isn&#8217;t one) or whether they&#8217;ve been drinking. &nbsp;The basis of admission <i>while a service is running</i> is whether they&#8217;ll disrupt the service.<br /><br />The last and least pleasant thing that I&#8217;ve had to deal with is men being creeps to women. &nbsp;Once or twice we&#8217;ve had men corner women and make repeated, unwanted advances. &nbsp;At least one such man has freely confessed to using pick-up artist tactics to try to &#8220;trick&#8221; (his words) women into giving him their phone numbers.<br /><br />The last incident like that happened while I was on duty, and frankly, I didn&#8217;t know what to do. &nbsp;I tried once to talk to him but he gave me the brush off, so the rest of the evening I stuck to him like glue. &nbsp;Useless. &nbsp;His overall pattern of behaviour was clearly, obviously dodgy but there was no single action I could point to that I could confidently call out. &nbsp;How odd it is to feel bound by social norms while someone else dances on their edge. Should I say something? &nbsp;What should I say? &nbsp;Why isn&#8217;t she asking for help? Am I white-knighting? &nbsp;What if I tell him to stop and he says &#8216;stop what&#8217;? &nbsp;Is there something innocuous I can say to draw him into conversation? Next time – and sadly, there&#8217;ll probably be a next time – I&#8217;ll just be rude. It&#8217;ll probably be a mistake, but at least it&#8217;ll be a different one.<br /><br />And that&#8217;s pretty much it. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve focused on the difficult bits, mostly I just end up sitting in the vestibule all evening, opening the door for people as they come in.<br /><br />I should add that this is all very much my own take on things, and whatever resemblance it has to the official stance of Christ Church Mayfair is purely coincidental.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

Phoning this one in, I&#8217;m afraid, since today has been that rarest of occasions: a Sunday almost entirely to myself.<br /><br />My normal Sunday consists of me getting up at around 9am and heading to St Johns church, picking up a coffee on the way. &nbsp;St Johns is an extremely casual church on a housing estate, embedded in some hideous brick skyscrapers. It nominally starts at 11am, but I&#8217;m on a roster often enough to need to be there by 10 or 10:30 a lot of weeks. &nbsp;Jolie&#8217;s always there before 10, grooving away on her bass.<br /><br />By the time the service is finished, and we&#8217;ve done chatting with everyone, it&#8217;s about 1:30pm and we start wandering home. When the weather is even a little bit nice, we walk, since it&#8217;s pleasant and mostly flat. I carry Jolie&#8217;s bass so people will think I&#8217;m cooler than I actually am.<br /><br />Then we get home, and I start bashing out my Alphabet Supremacy piece for the week, Jolie makes us lunch and when all that&#8217;s done we chill out until about 4:30 - 5pm when we leave for the things we&#8217;re rostered on for at Christ Church Mayfair. We don&#8217;t get back from there until around 9:30pm.<br /><br />I do all of that because it&#8217;s important to me. But sometimes, it&#8217;s nice to have a solid chunk of time when I just get things done.<br /><br />Today has provided such an opportunity, as I&#8217;ve been obliged to spend the day at home. It&#8217;s been wonderful. I&#8217;ve been able to do so many dull but essential things like laundry, budgeting (you&#8217;d think that lists of numbers that add up to zero would be less work), a little bit of writing, and a lot of todos that will make the week run smoother for having done them (wedding invitations don&#8217;t become calendar appointments by themselves!).<br /><br />I&#8217;ve also had a chance to listen to Das Rheingold for the first time. &nbsp;It&#8217;s really good, and I&#8217;m looking forward to listening to it again and perhaps even <i>watching</i>&nbsp;it, so I can figure out who is singing what.<br /><br />Now the geas which kept me housebound has broken and I&#8217;m off to CCM. Plans won&#8217;t get me back in time to write something more suitable, so you&#8217;ll have to look to Mr Dibley to supply the quality for the week.<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">.

The day starts with the sound of the ocean gently, steadily and, alas, digitally getting louder and louder until I can do the sums required to turn it off. &nbsp;It&#8217;s followed by a lot of hot water, a few cuts to the face, a walk past a church cum Indian cultural centre cum Ingress portal before I take a short ride getting way too familiar with the sights and scents of commuters&#8217; armpits. &nbsp;If I took the slightly longer route, I&#8217;d walk past the place Gandhi lived when he was a law student, but I won&#8217;t because it&#8217;s hot and I&#8217;m carrying fifteen pounds of kickboxing gear on my back.<br /><br />Victoria Station is vast and frenetic. &nbsp;Everyone is in the way. &nbsp;It is impossible to not be stressed here. &nbsp;Well, maybe Gandhi could have managed it. I&#8217;m hungry and everything smells of bakery. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t eat much bread these days, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to leap the counter and forcefully grab a half-dozen croissants. &nbsp;The Japanese couple struggling up the stairs with suitcases twice as large as themselves misinterpret my snarl. &nbsp;I really should offer to help, but the moment passes.<br /><br />I shuffle slowly through the Tallest Glass Revolving Doors in Europe, fishing in my pocket for my ID to show to building security. &nbsp;Every time I see any security guards or bouncers these days, I wonder what it would be like to fight them. &nbsp;There&#8217;s one guy here who I reckon would be vicious. &nbsp;He&#8217;s small and looks maybe forty-five or fifty, but he&#8217;s always weirdly alert. &nbsp;When I say &#8220;Good morning&#8221;, he seems to regard it as a distraction from his watch.<br /><br />Once I&#8217;m through, I get to my floor. &nbsp;By now it&#8217;s familiar to me, but I still take the time to appreciate it. &nbsp;The corridors aren&#8217;t just soulless tunnels, but rich, interesting places with colour and texture. &nbsp;The deli &amp; micro-kitchens are cosy and relaxed. &nbsp;My desk maybe technically possibly counts as a cubical, but hasn&#8217;t ever felt that way to me.<br /><br />The first thing I do is get coffee, which Shakespeare would have called the chief nourisher in life&#8217;s feast if he only knew what he was on about. &nbsp;The coffee from the push-button machine isn&#8217;t great, but it works enough to get me ready to use the espresso machine for my sophomore cup.<br /><br />I worked from home for about eight years, in one way or another, and mostly enjoyed it. &nbsp;Now I&#8217;m here, I don&#8217;t miss it at all. &nbsp;Well, sometimes it&#8217;s a bit noisy, but there&#8217;s a beautiful, dark, quiet room where I can escape. &nbsp;The food is better, my computer is better, and the company is better.<br /><br />That is, one of the things I enjoy most about my trade is sitting around with a team, working together on something interesting. &nbsp;At my previous job, even though we worked from home mostly, we&#8217;d occasionally get together in some random city, sit in a room and hack on something for a solid week. &nbsp;Those weeks (NB:&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;the weeks where we sat around planning things) were the most fun times in a job that was overall a pretty fun job. &nbsp;So why not do that all the time?<br /><br />The day starts to wind up, I slug my kickboxing bag over my shoulder and head out. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a different, friendlier security guard on duty, but I only really see his back and I think we&#8217;d both be uncomfortable if I turned around and said &#8220;Good morning&#8221;. &nbsp;I get to Victoria Station, and though it shouldn&#8217;t be mathematically possible there are even more people here, and they all hate me for lugging this great bloody thing around, taking up precious standing room. As I&#8217;m shoved onto the train to Euston, I can&#8217;t help but think that I love this city.<br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />This post is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.mumak.net/2013/01/the-alphabet-supremacy.html" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Alphabet Supremacy</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;project, a collaboration between myself and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://life.metagnome.net/" style="background-color: white; font-size: 13px;">Bice Dibley</a><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">.

I&#8217;m ashamed to say it, but we got absolutely spanked by the real estate agent who let us the flat where we&#8217;re now living. &nbsp;He talked us into higher rent, a longer lease and dropping the six month break clause. &nbsp;During the process of leasing it, he would hurry us up one day and stall us the next. &nbsp;He&#8217;d even tell us dubious half-truths about the place and the landlord. &nbsp;We like the place enough, and might even renew the release, but I don&#8217;t want to repeat that experience. &nbsp;Coming out with slightly less money and freedom is bad enough, but the process itself is slimy and humiliating.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not as if that was the first time I&#8217;ve walked away from a negotiation feeling like a sucker. &nbsp;Almost all of my previous tenancies and certain salary negotiations stand out as being terribly handled on my part.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always felt it&#8217;s slightly unfair that two of the most important factors in my material happiness – how much I earn and where I live – are so strongly determined by something I&#8217;m just not very good at. &nbsp;In the Benign and Enlightened Suzerainty of Jonathania, your compensation and residence would be a function of your skill in some core, valuable profession, such as computer programming.<br /><br />Since, alas, the world is not yet my demesne, I&#8217;ve been trying to level up in negotiation. &nbsp;For a long time, the most helpful thing I read was Valerie Aurora&#8217;s <a href="http://valerieaurora.org/howto_salary/">HOWTO on salary negotiation</a>, written for women, but useful enough for me. &nbsp;It helped me grok what I mentioned above, that I shouldn&#8217;t use being a geek as an excuse for being naïve.<br /><br />Then I picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Economist-Negotiation-Guide--Z/dp/1846681693/">Economist A-Z on negotiation</a>. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a really fun little read, and the ideal Father/Mother&#8217;s day present for the middle-class classical liberal in your life who already has everything. &nbsp;The highlights are the articles on &#8220;zero sum&#8221; (negotiation isn&#8217;t, which is why we haven&#8217;t had the merchant caste hanged already) and &#8220;children&#8221; (who play dirty and are thus the best negotiators, but get their comeuppance during courtship).<br /><br />But the most interesting and most recent book I&#8217;ve read on negotiation is Stuart Diamond&#8217;s &#8220;Getting More&#8221;. &nbsp;In it, Diamond asks us to stop thinking in terms of tactics and negotiating positions and to instead be crystal clear on our goals, understand where the other person is coming from and then help them meet our goals, mostly by framing your goals in a way that makes it easy for them to meet, by trading things of unequal value, and by holding them to their own standards.<br /><br />The book is crammed with anecdotes. &nbsp;No matter how small a slice of this book you take, you will find a positive, upbeat story about how one of his students used these principles to &#8220;get more&#8221;. &nbsp;If you had to drink a shot every time you came across one, they&#8217;d be wheeling in the stomach pump halfway through page two. &nbsp;By the end, you&#8217;ve been pummelled with so many that you&#8217;ve forgotten what the book is about.<br /><br />The underlying principles do seem sound, and when I&#8217;ve spoken with people who&#8217;ve read &#8220;Crucial Confrontations&#8221;, they say it very much matches the ideas in that book. &nbsp;I just wish that Diamond had put in more bullet point summaries or something to make the book seem more structured and less meandering.<br /><br />The closest he gets to an actual schema is in his &#8220;Planning&#8221; section, which has something close to a diagram, but is really just a few lists arranged in a grid. &nbsp;I wish he flagged that and said &#8220;this is it, this is the first and last chance you&#8217;ll have to see everything on one page&#8221;.<br /><br />There are a few times where his suggestions seem a touch unsavoury. &nbsp;When he talks about trading things of unequal value, he suggests &#8220;make emotional payments&#8221;, which is a fancy way of saying that you should strive to be kind and well-mannered. &nbsp;And if there&#8217;s a thing that I would be happy to buy for £100 and I negotiate the purchase for £80, then how exactly is that different from tricking the seller out of £20?<br /><br />Sadly, that&#8217;s all rather hypothetical. &nbsp;The one or two times I&#8217;ve tried to apply the ideas in the book, I&#8217;ve ended up happily and politely doing what I&#8217;m told.<br /><br />I just hope that the next real estate agent I deal with throws in a lollipop.<br /><div><br /></div><div><span style="background-color: white;

I feel your pain! Oh man, I really suck at this too. It just goes so against the grain for me. I have wondered if it&#39;s an introvert thing. I actually find it a lot easier to do over the phone or in writing. </div>
